}
"Scenario 1: Test for Zero Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithZeroInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to zero using the setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the average calculation handles zero inputs correctly. This test is significant because it tests the lower boundary of the input domain.

Scenario 2: Test for Positive Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithPositiveInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when both inputs are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to positive values using the setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the expected average based on the formula.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the average calculation works correctly with positive inputs. This test is significant because it tests the normal operation of the method.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNegativeInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when both inputs are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to negative values using the setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the expected average based on the formula.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the average calculation handles negative inputs correctly. This test is significant because it tests the method's handling of negative values, which could occur in certain scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithLargeInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when both inputs are very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to very large values using the setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the expected average based on the formula.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the average calculation can handle large inputs without overflow. This test is significant because it tests the upper boundary of the input domain.
