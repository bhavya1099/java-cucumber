================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-0248: Untrusted Inputs in 'getAverage()' method
Issue: The current 'getAverage()' method does not validate 'a' and 'b', and directly performs a computation using these values. If the input is controlled by an attacker, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: You should validate all inputs before using them in computation. Confirm that 'a' and 'b' are within expected boundaries or values before performing the computation.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: If the sum of the weights (3.5 and 7.5 in the code) equals zero, then it will cause a divide by zero error. This could be exploited by an attacker to crash your system or cause it to enter an undefined state.
Solution: You should introduce a check to ensure that the denominator is never zero before performing the division operation. An error or exception should be thrown if a zero denominator is encountered.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test Method with Valid Random Inputs

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithRandomInputs.
    Description: This will test if getAverage method returns the correct average when invoked with valid a and b values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize variables a and b with any random double values.
    Act: Invoke getAverage using initialized a and b values.
    Assert: Assert if the result is equal to the average i.e., (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0
  Validation:
     Since the object is initialised with random valid values, the expectation is that the computed average will be correct as per formula (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0


  Scenario 2: Test Method with Zero Input

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithZeroInput.
    Description: This test will see how the getAverage method reacts when zero is used as an input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign 0 to both a and b.
    Act: Instead of a and b, use getAverage.
    Assert: Assert if the outcome is equal to 0.0
  Validation:
    Since 0.0 for both inputs has been used, the expected output is also 0.0 as per the average calculation formula.


  Scenario 3: Test Method with Negative Inputs

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithNegativeInputs.
    Description:  This test will see how the getAverage method reacts when one or both inputs are negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign negative double values for a and b.
    Act: Instead of a and b, use getAverage.
    Assert: Assert if the outcome is the average i.e., (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0
  Validation:
    We anticipate that the program will operate normally despite the use of negatives. Thus, the calculated average should be correct based on the provided formula.


  Scenario 4: Test Method with Extremely Large Input Values

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithLargeInputs.
    Description: This test is designed to test the getAverage method's capacity to function properly under extreme parameter values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use extremely large double values for a and b.
    Act: Instead of a and b, use getAverage.
    Assert: Assert if the outcome is the average i.e., (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0
  Validation:
    We're testing the program's accuracy and stability here. Despite the fact that the inputs are extremely large, the program should still accurately calculate the averages.
