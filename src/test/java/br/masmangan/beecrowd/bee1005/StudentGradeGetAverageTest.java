"Scenario 1: Test for valid average calculation with positive numbers

Details:
    TestName: testValidAveragePositiveNumbers
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage() method when both a and b are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set a and b to positive numbers.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct when both a and b are positive numbers. This is important as it checks the basic functionality of the getAverage() method.

Scenario 2: Test for valid average calculation with negative numbers

Details:
    TestName: testValidAverageNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage() method when both a and b are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set a and b to negative numbers.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct when both a and b are negative numbers. This is important as it checks the getAverage() method's handling of negative values.

Scenario 3: Test for valid average calculation with zero

Details:
    TestName: testValidAverageWithZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage() method when either a or b is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set a to a positive number and b to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct when either a or b is zero. This is important as it checks the getAverage() method's handling of zero values.

Scenario 4: Test for valid average calculation with a and b as maximum double values

Details:
    TestName: testValidAverageMaxDoubleValues
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage() method when both a and b are maximum double values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set a and b to maximum double values.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct when both a and b are maximum double values. This is important as it checks the getAverage() method's handling of maximum double values.
