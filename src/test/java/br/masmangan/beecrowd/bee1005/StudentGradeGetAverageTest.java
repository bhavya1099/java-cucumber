"Scenario 1: Test for a Positive Average
Details:  
  TestName: testPositiveAverageScenario
  Description: This test checks the getAverage method for a positive average scenario. It tests the functionality of the method when both a and b are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to positive values using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is a positive number.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are positive. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the getAverage method.
Scenario 2: Test for a Negative Average
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeAverageScenario
  Description: This test checks the getAverage method for a negative average scenario. It tests the functionality of the method when both a and b are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to negative values using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is a negative number.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are negative. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getAverage method for negative input.
Scenario 3: Test for Zero Average
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroAverageScenario
  Description: This test checks the getAverage method for a zero average scenario. It tests the functionality of the method when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to zero using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are zero. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getAverage method for zero input.
Scenario 4: Test for Average with Mixed Sign Inputs
Details:  
  TestName: testMixedSignInputsScenario
  Description: This test checks the getAverage method for a scenario where a and b have opposite signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a to a positive value and b to a negative value using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is correct as per the formula (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when a and b have opposite signs. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getAverage method for mixed sign inputs.
