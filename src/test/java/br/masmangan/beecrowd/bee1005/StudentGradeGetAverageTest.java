```
Scenario 1: Basic Calculation with Positive Numbers

Details:
    TestName: calculateAverageWithPositiveScores
    Description: Test the average score computation when both input scores (a and b) are positive. This will help ensure that the method correctly calculates the weighted average in typical scenarios.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a to 30.0 and set b to 40.0 using setA and setB respectively.
    Act: Invoke getAverage().
    Assert: Assert the result of getAverage() is equal to ((30*3.5 + 40*7.5) / 11.0).
Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic.

Scenario 2: Calculation with Zero Scores

Details:
    TestName: calculateAverageWithZeroScores
    Description: Checks the method's response when both scores are zero. This ensures that the formula handles zero values without any issues.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a to 0 and set b to 0.
    Act: Invoke getAverage().
    Assert: Assert that the result of getAverage() is 0.0.
Validation:
    Clarify that zero weighted contributions from scores do not affect the average and return zero, which is mathematicaly correct and expected in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Calculation with Negative Scores

Details:
    TestName: calculateAverageWithNegativeScores
    Description: Ensures that the method correctly calculates averages when scores are negative, which might occur in systems allowing penalty or negative marking.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a to -10 and set b to -20.
    Act: Invoke getAverage().
    Assert: Assert the result of getAverage() matches the expected negative result.
Validation:
    Checks that the method can handle unusual yet possible input scenarios where scores are negative, validating the computation's correctness under these conditions.

Scenario 4: Calculation with Maximum Boundary Values

Details:
    TestName: calculateAverageWithMaxBoundaryValues
    Description: Tests the average score computation with very high values for scores to check for any integer overflow or arithmetic anomalies.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a to Double.MAX_VALUE and set b to Double.MAX_VALUE.
    Act: Invoke getAverage().
    Assert: Verify that the result is a finite number and does not result in infinity or errors.
Validation:
    Ensures that the method can handle extremely large values, which is essential for robustness and correctness in computations involving high numerical values.

Scenario 5: Mismatched Scale Scores

Details:
    TestName: calculateAverageWithMismatchedScales
    Description: Verifies correct average calculation when there's a significant difference between the values of a and b.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a to 1 and set b to 1000.
    Act: Invoke getAverage().
    Assert: Assert the result to verify accurate computation under disproportionate score scales.
Validation:
    Validates that the method can correctly weight and average scores even when they differ significantly, ensuring the method's reliability across a wide range of inputs.
