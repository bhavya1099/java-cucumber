"""
Scenario 1: Test the average for positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAverageOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test looks to validate the proper functioning of the getAverage() method when given positive numbers for inputs a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Set a to be 5.0 and b to be 10.0 using the respective setters.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage() method of the StudentGrade instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is the expected value of 8.18 (accurate to two decimal places).
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the correct calculation of the average. The expected result is derived from the given equation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0.
  The significance of the test is to ensure that the system computes and returns accurate averages when provided with positive values for a and b.
Scenario 2: Test the average for zero inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageForZeroInputs
  Description: This test validates the functionality of the getAverage() method when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the StudentGrade object, set both a and b to be 0 using the respective setters.
  Act: Call getAverage() method on the StudentGrade instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion tests that the calculation of the average correctly handles scenarios where a and b are both zero.
  This test is significant to ascertain that the system doesn't crash or return incorrect results when the inputs are at their minimum allowable values.
Scenario 3: Test the average for maximum inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageForMaximumInputs
  Description: Checks how the getAverage() method handles scenarios where a and b are at their maximum allowable values (Double.MAX_VALUE).
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the StudentGrade object. Set a and b to max values (Double.MAX_VALUE) using the setters.
  Act: Run the getAverage() method on the StudentGrade instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is not infinity.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method correctly handles a and b at their maximum values and does not result in numerical overflow.
  The significance of this test lies in its examination of how the system manages edge cases involving extremely large input values.

Scenario 4: Test the average for negative inputs
Details:
  TestName: testAverageForNegativeInputs
  Description: Evaluates the getAverage() function when negative arguments are used for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and initialize a and b to -3.0 and -6.0 using setters respectively.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage() method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is equal to -5.0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the system can handle negative inputs and calculates the correct negative average.
  The test's significance lies in ensuring the method's robustness in dealing with negative inputs.
Scenario 5: Test the average for mixed inputs (positive and negative)
Details:
  TestName: testAverageForMixedInputs
  Description: This test checks the getAverage() method's performance when a is a positive number, and b is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade, set a to 5.0 and b to -10.0 using setters.
  Act: Run the getAverage() method on the StudentGrade instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned average is the expected result of -3.18.
Validation:
  This case test verifies that the system calculates the correct average for mixed inputs.
  This test's importance is verifying the getAverage's ability to handle and correctly interpret mixed positive and negative inputs.
