"""
Scenario 1: Test with positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: shouldBeAbleToCalculateAverageForPositiveNumbers.
  Description: This test will check if the method `getAverage()` is capable of correctly calculating the average when both a and b fields are positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `a` and `b` fields to any positive numbers such as 2 and 3.
  Act: Call method `getAverage()`.
  Assert: Check if the computed average equals the manually computed one ((2*3.5 + 3*7.5) / 11.0).
Validation:
  Verify that the computed average of the numbers is correct, therefore validating the method's ability to calculate positive numbers' averages, which it is expected to do.

Scenario 2: Test with negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: shouldBeAbleToCalculateAverageForNegativeNumbers.
  Description: This test will make sure that the method can compute the average even when both the `a` and `b` parameters are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: The `a` and `b` fields are iteratively set to -2 and -3.
  Act: Invoke method `getAverage()`.
  Assert: Compare the computed average to the manual calculation ((-2*3.5 + -3*7.5) / 11.0).
Validation:
  Verify that the computed average of the numbers is correct, therefore validating the method's functionality when computing averages, this includes negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test with Zero

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnZeroWhenBothNumbersAreZero.
  Description: To check if the `getAverage()` method can correctly compute the average when both the `a` and `b` fields are initialized as zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Fields `a` and `b` are set to 0.
  Act: Method `getAverage()` is invoked.
  Assert: The output of the method equals zero, which is the expected average.
Validation:
  Check that the method properly computes the average when both input fields are zero, as this is a valid input scenario in our context.

Scenario 4: Test with Decimal numbers

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnAccurateAverageWhenNumbersAreDecimal.
  Description:  This test will validate if the method `getAverage()` is able to correctly compute the average for decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: The `a` and `b` fields are set to 1.5 and 2.5 respectively.
  Act: Method `getAverage()` is invoked.
  Assert: The average received from the method equals the manual calculation ((1.5*3.5 + 2.5*7.5) / 11.0).
Validation:
  It is validating that the method works effectively with fractional values, a key consideration with numerical calculations.
