================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-022: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
Issue: This can occur when the code uses user-supplied input to form file paths without sufficiently preventing directory traversal sequences or other inputs that can point to locations outside of the designated boundaries.
Solution: Use libraries to validate user inputs and make sure they don't contain directory traversal characters or sequences.

Vulnerability: CWE-089: SQL Injection
Issue: Can occur when the code directly includes user input in an SQL query without first sanitizing or parameterizing it, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
Solution: Use parameterized queries whenever possible, and if not, then properly sanitize user inputs before including them in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Occurs when user-supplied input is improperly sanitized before being returned as part of dynamically-generated HTML content, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript code into the page
Solution: Ensure that user inputs are properly escaped before being included in HTML content.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when both a and b are 0
Details:
    TestName: testWithZeroInputs
    Description: This test is meant to check if the correct average is returned when both a and b are zero. As the average formula uses a and b values, we expect the result to be zero when both are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set both a and b to be 0.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
    Assert: We expect to receive 0.
  Validation: The average of two zero-valued numbers should be zero.

Scenario 2: Test when a is 0 and b is nonzero
Details:
    TestName: testWithFirstVariableZero
    Description: This test is meant to verify whether the average is calculated correctly when a is 0 and second variable b is non-zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set a to be 0 and b to be any other number.
    Act: We call the getAverage method.
    Assert: We expect to receive a positive number.
  Validation: A positive number should be returned as only the multiplication with the non-zero variable contributes to the average.

Scenario 3: Test when a is nonzero and b is 0
Details:
    TestName: testWithSecondVariableZero
    Description: This test is meant to ensure that the method can handle and accurately calculate the average when b is zero and a has a nonzero number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A nonzero number is set for a while b is set to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
    Assert: We expect to receive a positive number.
  Validation: The result should be positive as only the multiplication with the non-zero variable (a) contributes to the average.

Scenario 4: Test when a and b are both non-zero
Details:
    TestName: testWithBothVariablesNonZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct operation of the method when both variables are non-zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign non-zero values to variables a and b.
    Act: Call the getAverage method.
    Assert: Expect a valid average value that is larger than both a and b.
  Validation: The weight of b is larger than that of a in the formula, so the average should be closer to b if both a and b are positive.

Scenario 5: Test when a or b is negative
Details:
    TestName: testWithNegativeVariables
    Description: This test is meant to ensure that the method can handle and accurately calculate the average when one (or both) of the variables is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a negative value to a or b.
    Act: Call the getAverage method.
    Assert: Expect the return value to be possible negative.
  Validation: As both the variables are used in the average calculation, a negative value in one (or both) variables should reduce the output average.

Scenario 6: Floating Point Test
Details:
    TestName: testWithFloatingPointInputs
    Description: This scenario is designed to assess the functionality of the getAverage method with floating point inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign floating point values to both variables a and b.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
    Assert: Expect the return value to be a double value.
  Validation: This test verifies if the function supports floating point calculations and returns a valid output.
