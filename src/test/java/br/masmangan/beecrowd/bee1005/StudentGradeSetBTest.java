"""
Scenario 1: Test method when the value of b is a positive number

Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithPositiveNumber
    Description: This test case checks if the method is capable of storing positive values of b correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: N/A (no need to setup anything as method does not depend on prior state)
    Act: Invoke setB method with a positive number as an input.
    Assert: Use Java reflection (or a getter if it exists) to fetch the value of b and assert it matches the input.
Validation:
    Test asserts that the method can handle and holds positive numbers correctly. This is essential because the application behavior might require storing positive values.

Scenario 2: Test method when the value of b is a negative number

Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithNegativeNumber
    Description: This test case confirms if the method setB can store negative values of b accurately.
Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke setB method with a negative number as an input.
    Assert: Use Java reflection (or a getter if it exists) to fetch the value of b and assert it matches the input.
Validation:
    Test asserts that the method can handle and holds negative values accurately. Working with negative values might be required in the logic of the application.

Scenario 3: Test method when the value of b is zero

Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithZero
    Description: This test case is for checking if the method properly holds the value of zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke setB method with zero as an input.
    Assert: Use Java reflection (or a getter if it exists) to fetch the value of b and assert it is zero.
Validation:
    Test asserts that the method can hold zero values. Zero might be a crucial value in the context of application logic (like resetting values).

Scenario 4: Test method with maximum double value

Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithMaxDouble
    Description: This test verifies how the method deals with the maximum possible values for double in Java.
Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke setB method with Double.MAX_VALUE as an input.
    Assert: Use Java reflection (or a getter if it exists) to fetch the value of b and assert it equals Double.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
    Test confirms that the method can handle the maximum limit of double type. It affirms that the method can store the largest possible values if such a scenario occurs.

Scenario 5: Test method with minimum double value

Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithMinDouble
    Description: This test verifies how the method deals with the minimum possible values for double in Java.
Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke setB method with Double.MIN_VALUE as an input.
    Assert: Use Java reflection (or a getter if it exists) to fetch the value of b and assert it equals Double.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
    Test ensures that the method can cope with the lowest limit of double type. It confirms that the method can store the smallest possible values if such a situation arises.
