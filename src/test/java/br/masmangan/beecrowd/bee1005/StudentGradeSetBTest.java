"""
Scenario 1: Test the setB method with positive input
Details:
    TestName: testSetBPositiveInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the setB method when a positive double value is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a studentGrade object.
    Act: Invoke the setB method on the studentGrade object, passing 5.0 as argument.
    Assert: Use a getter method if provided or reflection to verify that the value of b has been set correctly in the studentGrade object.
  Validation:
    This test will verify if the method correctly sets the positive double value. If the method works correctly, the b value of studentGrade object should hold 5.0 after the method execution.
Scenario 2: Test the setB method with negative input
Details:
    TestName: testSetBNegativeInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the setB method when a negative double value is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a studentGrade object.
    Act: Invoke the setB method on the studentGrade object, passing -5.0 as argument.
    Assert: Use a getter method if provided or reflection to verify that the value of b has been set correctly in the studentGrade object.
  Validation:
    This test will verify if the method correctly handles a negative double value. If the method works correctly, the b value of studentGrade object should hold -5.0 after the method execution.
Scenario 3: Test the getAverage method after setting B
Details:
    TestName: testGetAverageAfterSettingB
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly reflects the change in value of b after setB method is invoked.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a studentGrade object and set value of a=6.0
    Act: Invoke the setB method on the studentGrade object, passing 4.0 as argument.
    Assert: Call getAverage method and assert the returned value against the expected average.
  Validation:
    This test will verify if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average considering the new value of b set by setB method. If the method works correctly, after setting b to 4.0, the getAverage should return 5.0.
- This is a reasonable number of test scenarios for the provided method, covering the most likely edge cases. If there are other scenarios to consider (for example, other input types, asynchronous behavior), additional test cases should be created.
