```
Scenario 1: Set a typical value for B

Details:
  TestName: setNormalValueForB
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setB method when setting a typical double value. It verifies if the value is set correctly by observing changes in the average calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set a value for 'a' to maintain a consistent state.
  Act: Set 'b' to a typical value, e.g., 85.0 using setB method.
  Assert: Assert that the average calculated using getAverage reflects the correct influence of 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the average is (a * 3.5 + 85.0 * 7.5) / 11.0, confirming that 'b' is factored correctly in the calculation. This is significant as it confirms proper state management within the entity.

Scenario 2: Set a zero value for B

Details:
  TestName: setZeroForB
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the setB method when setting 'b' to zero. It is important to ensure that the method correctly handles zero values, especially in calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set a value for 'a'.
  Act: Set 'b' to 0.0 using setB method.
  Assert: Assert that the average calculated using getAverage is correct and reflects the zero value set for 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the average is calculated as (a * 3.5 + 0.0 * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is crucial for validating that the grade calculation correctly handles edge cases such as zero values.

Scenario 3: Set a negative value for B

Details:
  TestName: setNegativeValueForB
  Description: This test examines how the setB method deals with negative values. Since grades typically shouldn't be negative, this test checks if the method can handle such inputs without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set a positive value for 'a'.
  Act: Set 'b' to a negative value, e.g., -10.0 using setB method.
  Assert: Assert that the average calculated using getAverage reflects the negative value correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the average is calculated as (a * 3.5 - 10.0 * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the grade calculation logic under unusual but possible input scenarios.

Scenario 4: Set an extremely high value for B

Details:
  TestName: setExtremelyHighValueForB
  Description: This test verifies the setB method's behavior when an exceptionally high value is set for 'b'. It ensures that the method can handle large values without overflow or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade, set a value for 'a'.
  Act: Set 'b' to a very high value, e.g., 1e9 using setB method.
  Assert: Assert that the average calculated using getAverage is correct and can handle large values.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the average is calculated as (a * 3.5 + 1e9 * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is essential to ensure that the application can handle large input values gracefully, which might be critical in environments with varied data ranges.
