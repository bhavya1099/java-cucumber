================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential data leakage / tampering (CWE-494)
Issue: The method setB allows external entities to modify the internal state of the object. This can lead to potential leaks or manipulation of sensitive data.
Solution: Enforce encapsulation by restricting unnecessary access to the object's inner state. If external write access is required, consider implementing validation logic to ensure that only valid data is accepted.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The method setB accepts any double value, which might be inappropriate and may introduce software defects or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Add appropriate bounds / conditions check before setting the value of b.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when value of b is positive

Details:
  TestName: testWhenBIsPositive
  Description: This test is to check whether the method successfully updates the value of "b" when a positive number is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data to arrange as this is a simple setter method.
  Act: Invoke the "setB" method with a positive number (e.g., 10.5).
  Assert: Check the value of "b" after invoking the method. It should equal to the number used when invoking the method.
Validation:
  This is a basic validation to ensure that the setter method correctly updates the value of "b" when a positive number is used. The expected result here is 10.5 as this is the new value of "b". The importance lies in the basic functionality of setter methods in Object Oriented Programming.

Scenario 2: Test when value of b is zero

Details:
  TestName: testWhenBEqualsZero
  Description: This test is to check whether the method successfully updates the value of "b" when the value 0 is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data to arrange as this is a simple setter method.
  Act: Invoke the "setB" method with 0.
  Assert: Check the value of "b" after invoking the method. It should equal to zero.
Validation:
  This checks if the setter method correctly updates the value of "b" when zero is used. The expected result here is 0 as this is the new value of "b". It is important to test such edge cases to avoid potential bugs in the system.

Scenario 3: Test when value of b is negative

Details:
  TestName: testWhenBIsNegative
  Description: This test is to check if the method can update the value of "b" to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data to arrange as this is a simple setter method.
  Act: Invoke the "setB" method with a negative number (e.g., -5.4).
  Assert: Check the value of "b" after invoking the method. It should equal to the number used when invoking the method.
Validation:
  This test case is important to make sure that the setter can handle any type of double value (positive, zero or negative) and working as expected. The expected result is -5.4 as this is the new value of "b".
