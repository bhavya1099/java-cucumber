"""
Scenario 1: Testing the 'setB' method with a valid B value
  Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithValidValue
    Description: The test is meant to verify whether the 'setB' method successfully stores a valid B value into the 'b' member variable.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new 'StudentGrade' object and a valid double value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method on the newly created 'StudentGrade' object with the valid 'b' value.
    Assert: Use a hypothetical 'getB' method (assuming it exists) to retrieve the value of 'b' from the 'StudentGrade' object and compare it with the initial valid 'b' value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the value set using 'setB' is correctly stored in the 'b' member variable. The test will pass if both values match, confirming 'setB' functionality.
Scenario 2: Testing the impact of 'setB' on 'getAverage'
  Details:
    TestName: testAverageAfterSetB
    Description: This test checks whether changing the 'b' value using 'setB' affects the value returned by the 'getAverage' method appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new 'StudentGrade' object and set 'a' and 'b' with certain initial values. Also calculate the expected average using these values.
    Act: Invoke 'setB' method to change 'b' value and then call 'getAverage'.
    Assert: Compare the new average with the expected average.
  Validation:
    This test verifies if 'setB' method correctly updates the 'b' value such that the 'getAverage' calculation uses this new value. This insures 'getAverage' method and 'setB' method integration.
Scenario 3: Testing 'setB' method with a negative value
  Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithNegativeValue
    Description: The test aims to verify whether 'setB' can handle negative values, assuming 'b' represents some quantity that cannot be negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new 'StudentGrade' object and a negative value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method on the 'StudentGrade' object with the negative 'b' value.
    Assert: This depends on how 'setB' is expected to handle negative input. If an exception is expected, the test should assert if such has been thrown.
  Validation:
    This test scenario adds robustness to the application by ensuring it handles invalid input gracefully, maintaining software reliability.
"""
NOTE: The setB method can have several other tests like testing with maximum double value, minimum double value, and also checking for concurrency issues if multiple threads are setting different values at the same time, etc. But without specifics on the 'b' field, the other methods in the class, and the application requirements, it's not advisable to make more assumptions and thereby provide more test scenarios.
