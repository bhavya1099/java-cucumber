Scenario 1: Test to set a positive value
Details:
  TestName: testSetPositiveValueForB
  Description: This test checks that the value of B can be set to a positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object.
    Act: Call setB with a positive double value, like 1.0.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of B has been set to the passed in value.
  Validation:
    Clarify that the assertion will check that B is equal to the passed in value. The test ensures that the setB method works as expected by assigning the specified value to the variable B.

Scenario 2: Test to set a negative value
Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativeValueForB
  Description: This test checks that the value of B can be set to a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object.
    Act: Call setB with a negative double value, like -1.0.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of B has been set to the passed in value.
  Validation:
    Clarify that the assertion will check that B is equal to the passed in value. The test ensures that the setB method works as expected even with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test to set a zero value
Details:
  TestName: testSetZeroValueForB
  Description: This test checks that the value of B can be set to zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object.
    Act: Call setB with a zero value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of B has been set to the zero value.
  Validation:
    Clarify that the assertion will check that B is equal to the passed in value. This test is important to ascertain that the method setB works correctly even when setting the value to zero.

Scenario 4: Test to set a very large value
Details:
  TestName: testSetLargeValueForB
  Description: This test checks that the value of B can be set to a very large double number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object.
    Act: Call setB with a very large double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of B has been set to the passed in value.
  Validation:
    Clarify that the assertion will check that B is equal to the passed in value. This test is crucial to verify that the method setB is capable of handling large numbers without any issues.

Scenario 5: Test to set a very small decimal value
Details:
  TestName: testSetSmallDecimalValueForB
  Description: This test checks that the value of B can be set to a very small decimal number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object.
    Act: Call setB with a very small decimal value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of B has been set to the passed in value.
  Validation:
    Clarify that the assertion will check that B is equal to the passed in value. This test is essential to verify that the method setB can handle very small decimal numbers accurately without any rounding issues.
