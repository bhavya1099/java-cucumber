Scenario 1: Normal Flow Test where the given value is within the permitted range

Details:
  TestName: setBWithPermittedValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the basic functionality of setB method when providing a value within the permitted range, the test should pass.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with a valid parameter, say setB(25).
    Assert: Use junit assertions to check that 'b' field's value is '25'.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the value of 'b' is successfully set to the input we provided. This is the basic and most straightforward use-case scenario for the "SetB" method - to set 'b' field value to the appropriate value.

Scenario 2: Set the maximum double value for 'b'

Details:
  TestName: setBWithMaximumValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the setB method, particularly for setting maximum double value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with max double value, say setB(Double.MAX_VALUE).
    Assert: Assert that the 'b' field's value is set to MAX double value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the setB method can handle the upper edge case of accepting maximum possible double value. Here, we test the upper bounds of the method.

Scenario 3: Providing a negative value

Details:
  TestName: setBWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is aimed to check the method if provided negative value, the method should still work fine as negative values are permitted.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with a negative value, say setB(-100).
    Assert: Assert that the 'b' field's value is '-100'.
  Validation:
    This assertion validates that the method accepts negative values without throwing errors. Here, we test the behavior of the method with negative value edge case.
