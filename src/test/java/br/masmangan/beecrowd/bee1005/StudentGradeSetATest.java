  Scenario 1: Testing normal operation of method setA

  Details:
    TestName: testNormalOperationSetA
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's ability to correctly set the value of variable 'a'
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required.
    Act: Invoke method setA with a value of 5.0
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value of 5.0
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method has correctly set the value of 'a'. The result is expected because the method simply sets 'a' to the provided value.


  Scenario 2: Testing operation of method setA with negative value

  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeValueSetA
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's ability to handle a negative value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required.
    Act: Invoke method setA with a value of -2.0
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value of -2.0
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method has correctly set the value of 'a' even with a negative value. The negative value should not hinder the operation of the method.


  Scenario 3: Testing operation of method setA with zero value

  Details:
    TestName: testZeroValueSetA
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's ability to handle a zero value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required.
    Act: Invoke method setA with a value of 0.0
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value of 0.0
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method has correctly set the value of 'a' even with a zero value. A zero value should not hinder the operation of the method.

  Scenario 4: Testing operation of method setA with maximum double value

  Details:
    TestName: testMaxValueSetA
    Description: This test is meant to check the method's ability to handle the maximum double value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required.
    Act: Invoke method setA with a value of Double.MAX_VALUE
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value of Double.MAX_VALUE
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method has correctly set the value of 'a' even with the maximum double value. The provided value should not hinder the operation of the method.
