Scenario 1: Valid Double Value for Method

Details:
  TestName: testSetAWithValidValue.
  Description: This test is meant to validate if the method setA() saves the provided value correctly when passed a valid double value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a double value, let's say 5.0.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized variable.
    Assert: Use a getA() method (assuming there is one for the getter method) in JUnit assertion to compare if the given value has been saved correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify whether the provided value has been saved and retrieved correctly from the object. This test is significant in ensuring the basic storing capability of a method.

Scenario 2: Test With the Maximum Allowed Double Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetAWithMaxDoubleValue.
  Description: This test is designed to see if the method can handle and store the maximum possible double value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a double variable the maximum value that a double data type can have in Java (i.e., Double.MAX_VALUE).
    Act: Invoke the setA method with this variable.
    Assert: Use a getA() method (assuming there is one for the getter method) in JUnit assertion to compare if the given value has been accurately saved.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify the method's capacity to hold the maximum allowed double value. This test ensures the method's reliability under extreme conditions.

Scenario 3: Test With the Minimum Allowed Double Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetAWithMinDoubleValue.
  Description: This test is designed to see if the method can handle and store the minimum possible double value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a double variable the minimum value that a double data type can have in Java (i.e., Double.MIN_VALUE).
    Act: Invoke the setA method with this variable.
    Assert: Use a getA() method (assuming there is one for the getter method) in JUnit assertion to compare if the given value has been accurately saved.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to test the method's capacity to hold the minimum allowed double value. This test ensures the method's reliability under extreme conditions.

Scenario 4: Test With a Negative Double Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetAWithNegativeValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA() can handle negative double values correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a negative double value, let's say -5.0.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized variable.
    Assert: Use a getA() method (assuming there is one for the getter method) in JUnit assertion to compare if the given value has been saved correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify whether the method correctly stores and retrieves negative values. This test is significant as it evaluates the method's ability to handle negative numbers.
