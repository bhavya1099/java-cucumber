```
Scenario 1: Setting a positive value for 'a'

Details:
  TestName: setAPositiveValue
  Description: This test checks if the setter method setA correctly assigns a positive double value to the field 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a StudentGrade object.
  Act: Call setA method with a positive double value, e.g., setA(3.5).
  Assert: Use getAverage method to verify if the value is set correctly by checking if the average calculation reflects this change when 'b' is zero or another known value.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the correct assignment of the positive value to 'a' and its impact on the average calculation. This test validates the handling of typical positive input and its direct effect on the business logic for average calculation.

Scenario 2: Setting a negative value for 'a'

Details:
  TestName: setANegativeValue
  Description: This test checks if the setter method setA correctly handles negative double values by assigning it to the field 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a StudentGrade object.
  Act: Call setA method with a negative double value, e.g., setA(-1.5).
  Assert: Use getAverage method to verify that the negative value impacts the average calculation as expected.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks if negative values are handled correctly, impacting the average calculation, which is crucial for accurate academic performance evaluation.

Scenario 3: Setting zero as the value for 'a'

Details:
  TestName: setAWithZero
  Description: Tests if the setA method can handle zero as an input and correctly assign it to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a StudentGrade object.
  Act: Call setA with a value of 0.
  Assert: Use getAverage method to check that setting 'a' to zero is reflected in the average calculation, especially when 'b' is a non-zero value.
Validation:
  The test ensures that zero values, which could represent certain edge cases in grading scenarios, are correctly handled and calculated in the average.

Scenario 4: Setting a very large positive value for 'a'

Details:
  TestName: setAVeryLargePositiveValue
  Description: Ensures that the setA method can handle very large positive values without errors and correctly assigns them to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a StudentGrade object.
  Act: Call setA with a very large positive value, e.g., setA(1e9).
  Assert: Check with getAverage to ensure the large value is handled and calculated correctly.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the setA method in dealing with unusually high input values, ensuring the application's stability and correctness under extreme conditions.

Scenario 5: Floating point precision test for 'a'

Details:
  TestName: setAWithFloatingPointPrecision
  Description: This test checks how setA handles floating point precision values and ensures the precision is maintained in the average calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a StudentGrade object.
  Act: Call setA with a high precision floating point number, e.g., setA(3.1415926535).
  Assert: Utilize getAverage to verify that the precision is maintained in the calculations.
Validation:
  Asserts the accuracy and precision handling of floating point numbers in grading calculations, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of academic evaluations.
