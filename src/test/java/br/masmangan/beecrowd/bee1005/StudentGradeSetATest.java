"""
Scenario 1: Setting a grade in the normal range
Details:
  TestName: testSetGradeInNormalRange
  Description: This test checks whether the setA() method correctly sets a grade that is in the acceptable range (0 to 100).
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of StudentGrade is created and the grade to set is defined as 85.
  Act: Invoke the setA() method on the instance with the grade value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the setA() method correctly sets the grade.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the grade is correctly set. This is fundamental as grade assignment influences subsequent calculations like averaging.
Scenario 2: Attempting to set a grade below the lower limit
Details:
  TestName: testSetGradeBelowLowerLimit
  Description: This test checks if the setA() method handles the case where a grade value is set below the minimum acceptable value (0).
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of StudentGrade is created and the grade to set is defined as -10.
  Act: Invoke the setA() method on the instance with the grade value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the setA() method handles this error case correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies an error was thrown or the grade was not set. This is fundamental to prevent incorrect or unintended assignments.
Scenario 3: Attempting to set a grade above the upper limit
Details:
  TestName: testSetGradeAboveUpperLimit
  Description: This test checks if the setA() method handles the case where a grade value is set above the upper acceptable limit (100).
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of StudentGrade is created and the grade to set is defined as 110.
  Act: Invoke the setA() method on the instance with the grade value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the setA() method handles this error case correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies an error is thrown or the grade is not set. This ensures setA() method complies with the restrictions imposed on the grade range.
Scenario 4: Setting a grade on the boundary
Details:
  TestName: testSetGradeOnBoundary
  Description: This test checks if setA() method correctly sets a grade that is exactly on the boundary - either 0 or 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of StudentGrade is created and the grade to set is defined as 0 or 100.
  Act: Invoke the setA() method on the instance with the grade value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the setA() method correctly sets the boundary grade.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the boundary grade is correctly set. This ensures the setA() method can handle boundary values, which is crucial for accurate grade setting and calculation.
