Scenario 1: Setting A Negative Grading
TestName: setANegativeGrade
Description: This test scenario is meant to check the setA method when the input grade is negative.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the StudentGrade class needs to be created and a negative grade(a) should be provided.
    Act: The setA method would be invoked with a negative grade.
    Assert: We can’t define an assert statement as the setA method doesn't return anything.
Validation:
    This scenario would check the behavior of the method when inputted with a negative grade. However, it’s a void method, so we cannot validate it using JUnit. We expect no exceptions to be thrown.
Scenario 2: Setting A Zero Grade
TestName: setAZeroGrade
Description: This scenario tests the setA method when the grade is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the StudentGrade class and provide a zero grade (a).
    Act: The setA method would be invoked with a grade of zero.
    Assert: There are no infinity or negative outcomes as the method is void, negative assertions can't be defined.
Validation:
    This scenario would check the behavior of the method when inputted with a grade of zero. However, we can’t validate it using JUnit. We expect no exceptions to be thrown.
Scenario 3: Checking Average After Setting A Grade
TestName: checkAverageAfterSettingGrade
Description: This tests whether the getAverage method reflects the grade(a) inputted using setA.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a StudentGrade instance and input a grade (a) using setA and grade (b) using setB.
    Act: Invoke getAverage method.
    Assert: Use assert statement to compare the actual result of getAverage and the expected outcome( (a*3.5 + b*7.5) /11.0 ).
Validation:
    This validates that getAverage method properly reflects the grades input using setA and setB methods. It indicates that setA effectively inputs the grade (a) into the StudentGrade instance.
