Scenario 1: Positive Test - The student grade 'A' is set within a valid positive range
Details:
  TestName: testSetAPositiveRange
  Description: This test is designed to check whether the setA method of the StudentGrade entity can successfully set the grade 'A' within a valid positive range. For this instance, a grade of 95.5 is used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A new instance of the StudentGrade object is created.
    Act: The setA method is invoked with 95.5 as parameter
    Assert: An assertion is made that the average grade (calculated using getAverage method) matches the expected outcome when grade 'A' is 95.5 and 'B' is 0.
  Validation:
    The primary aim of this test is to verify whether the setA method can successfully update the grade 'A'. The calculated average grade should match the expected outcome provided that grade 'B' is set to 0. This is key to ensuring that the method correctly sets and updates the student's grades.
Scenario 2: Zero Test - The student grade 'A' is set to Zero
Details:
  TestName: testSetAZero
  Description: This test checks if the setA method of the StudentGrade entity can set the grade 'A' to 0 without any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A new instance of the StudentGrade object is created.
    Act: The setA method is invoked with 0 as the parameter
    Assert: An assertion is made that the average grade (calculated using getAverage method) is 0 when both 'A' and 'B' grades are 0.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify if the setA method can successfully set grade 'A' to 0. It's essential in the context where a student gets a grade of 0 in 'A', the method should be able to handle this scenario without errors.
Scenario 3: Negative Test - The student grade 'A' is set with a negative value
Details:
  TestName: testSetANegative
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setA method within StudentGrade can handle and appropriately react to negative input, given grades cannot be negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A new instance of the StudentGrade object is created.
    Act: The setA method is invoked with a negative value as the parameter
    Assert: As grades cannot be negative, an exception/error should be thrown. JUnit assertions to capture this scenario.
  Validation:
    The assertion here verifies whether the system correctly throws an exception when a negative grade is set, therefore protecting the integrity of the data entered into the system. This is important to avoid data corruption and ensure only valid grades are entered.
