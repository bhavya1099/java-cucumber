"""
Scenario 1: Positive Flow
Details:
    TestName: testSetASimplePositive
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets 'a' to a positive value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'a' with a positive value e.g., 5.
    Act: Call the setA() method with 'a' as parameter.
    Assert: Use 'getA()' method to check if returned value is equal to the previously set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates the correct assignment of the variable 'a'. This is an important test as it checks basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Zero input
Details:
    TestName: testSetAWithZero
    Description: This test checks what happens when the method is called with zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'a' with zero.
    Act: Call the setA() method with 'a' as parameter.
    Assert: Verify using 'getA()' method to check if returned value is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms the method is able to handle zero input correctly, this validates the method's basic error handling.

Scenario 3: Negative value
Details:
    TestName: testSetANegativeValue
    Description: This test will verify if the method can correctly set 'a' to a negative value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'a' with a negative value e.g., -5.
    Act: Call the setA() method with 'a' as parameter.
    Assert: Use 'getA()' method to check if returned value is equal to the previously set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies the functionality of the method with negative inputs. This is critical for ensuring comprehensive functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Maximum limit
Details:
    TestName: testSetWithMaxLimit
    Description: This test will check if the method correctly handles the maximum limit of double data type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'a' with the maximum value of double data type.
    Act: Call the setA() method with 'a' as parameter.
    Assert: Use 'getA()' method to check if returned value is equal to the previously set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates the method's handling of limit cases, which is crucial for overall error handling.


Scenario 5: Minimum Limit
Details:
    TestName: testSetWithMinLimit
    Description: This test will check if the method correctly handles the minimum limit of double data type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'a' with the minimum value of double data type.
    Act: Call the setA() method with 'a' as parameter.
    Assert: Use 'getA()' method to check if returned value is equal to the previously set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks the method's accurate handling of limit cases, which is an integral part of comprehensive error handling.
