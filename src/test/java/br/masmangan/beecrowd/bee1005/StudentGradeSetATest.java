Scenario 1: Test Scenario when 'a' is set to zero

Details:
    TestName: testSetAToZero.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check the functionality of setA when the parameter is set to zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We do not need any data, mocks, or test doubles in this scenario.
    Act: We invoke the setA method with zero as the parameter.
    Assert: We can use JUnit assertions to ensure that 'a' now holds the value zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method accurately sets 'a' to zero. This is crucial in ensuring that the setA method works properly and does not produce unintended side-effects when handling zero values.

Scenario 2: Test Scenario when 'a' is set to a positive value

Details:
    TestName: testSetAToPositiveValue.
    Description: This scenario tests the setA method when the parameter 'a' is set to a positive value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There are no data, mocks, or test doubles required in this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a positive value as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that 'a' has been set to the positive value passed.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the setA method can successfully handle and set positive values. This is essential to ensure that the method can handle numerical values within positive range expected in the business logic.

Scenario 3: Test Scenario when 'a' is set to a negative value

Details:
    TestName: testSetAToNegativeValue.
    Description: This scenario tests the setA functionality when the parameter 'a' is set to a negative value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need for data, mocks, or test doubles in this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a negative value as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that 'a' has been set to the negative value passed.
  Validation:
    This asserts that the setA method can successfully handle and set negative values. This is important to verify that the method can manage numerical values within the negative range, which may be a scenario in certain business logics.
