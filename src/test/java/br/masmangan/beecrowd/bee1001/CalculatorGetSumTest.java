"""
Scenario 1: Sum of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the sum of two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two private fields, a and b. Initialize a and b with some positive integers.
    Act: Invoke the getSum method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getSum method correctly adds two positive numbers.
    The correct sum of these integers is important for any calculations that depend on this method.
Scenario 2: Sum of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the sum of two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two private fields, a and b. Initialize a and b with some negative integers.
    Act: Invoke the getSum method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getSum method correctly adds two negative numbers.
    The correct sum of these integers is important for any calculations that depend on this method.
Scenario 3: Sum of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveAndNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the sum of a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two private fields, a and b. Initialize a and b with a positive and a negative integer respectively.
    Act: Invoke the getSum method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getSum method correctly adds a positive number and a negative number.
    The correct sum of these integers is important for any calculations that depend on this method.
Scenario 4: Sum of zero and an integer
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfZeroAndInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check the sum of zero and an integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two private fields, a and b. Initialize a with 0 and b with some integer.
    Act: Invoke the getSum method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getSum method correctly adds zero and an integer.
    The correct sum of these integers is important for any calculations that depend on this method.
Scenario 5: Sum of two zeros
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfTwoZeros
  Description: This test is meant to check the sum of two zeros.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two private fields, a and b. Initialize both a and b with 0.
    Act: Invoke the getSum method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated, and the result is 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getSum method correctly adds two zeros.
    This will validate if the method can handle two zeros as inputs without crashing and returns zero as expected.
