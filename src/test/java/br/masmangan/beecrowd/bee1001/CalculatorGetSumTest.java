ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getSum_61f2af7779
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d
Scenario 1: Test when both a and b are zero
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfZero
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to be zero.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expected result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of zero and zero is zero. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the edge case where both inputs are zero.
Scenario 2: Test when a and b are positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when both a and b are positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to be positive numbers.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expected result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two positive numbers is calculated correctly. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the common case where both inputs are positive numbers.
Scenario 3: Test when a and b are negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when both a and b are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to be negative numbers.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expected result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two negative numbers is calculated correctly. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the case where both inputs are negative numbers.
Scenario 4: Test when a is positive and b is negative
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveAndNegative
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when a is positive and b is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a to be a positive number and b to be a negative number.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expected result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a positive number and a negative number is calculated correctly. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the case where the inputs have different signs.
Scenario 5: Test when a is negative and b is positive
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegativeAndPositive
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when a is negative and b is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a to be a negative number and b to be a positive number.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expected result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a negative number and a positive number is calculated correctly. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the case where the inputs have different signs.
Scenario 6: Test when a and b are maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when a and b are maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to be maximum integer values.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The expectation is that an arithmetic overflow exception will be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles arithmetic overflow. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly handle the edge case where the sum of the inputs exceeds the maximum integer value.
