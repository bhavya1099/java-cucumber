"""
Scenario 1: Test the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are positive integers.
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum method when both input values 'a' and 'b' are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' to a positive integer. Set 'b' to a positive integer.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getSum method is equal to the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly computes the sum of two positive integers. This test is significant to ensure the method can handle common cases where both inputs are positive integers.

Scenario 2: Test the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are zero.
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithZeroValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum method when both input values 'a' and 'b' are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' to zero. Set 'b' to zero.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getSum method is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly computes the sum of two zeros. This test is significant to ensure the method can handle cases where both inputs are zeros.

Scenario 3: Test the getSum method when 'a' is a positive integer and 'b' is zero.
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveIntegerAndZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum method when 'a' is a positive integer and 'b' is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' to a positive integer. Set 'b' to zero.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getSum method is equal to 'a'.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly computes the sum of a positive integer and zero. This test is significant to ensure the method can handle cases where one input is a positive integer and the other is zero.

Scenario 4: Test the getSum method when 'a' and 'b' are negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' to a negative integer. Set 'b' to a negative integer.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getSum method is equal to the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the sum of two negative integers. This test is significant to ensure the method can handle scenarios where both inputs are negative integers.
