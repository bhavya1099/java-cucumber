Scenario 1: Test getSum when both 'a' and 'b' are positive values.

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveValues
  Description: The test is meant to verify the correct computation of the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize 'a' and 'b' as positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method works correctly with positive integers. The expected result is the sum of the positive integers.

Scenario 2: Test getSum when both 'a' and 'b' are negative values.

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeValues
  Description: The test is meant to verify the correct computation of the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize 'a' and 'b' as negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method works correctly with negative integers. The expected result is the sum of the negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test getSum when 'a' is positive and 'b' is negative value.

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveAndNegativeValues
  Description: The test is meant to verify the correct computation of the getSum method when 'a' is positive and 'b' is negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize 'a' as a positive integer and 'b' as a negative integer.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method works correctly with a positive and a negative integer. The expected result is the sum of the integers.

Scenario 4: Test getSum when 'a' is negative and 'b' is positive value.

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeAndPositiveValues
  Description: The test is meant to verify the correct computation of the getSum method when 'a' is negative and 'b' is positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize 'a' as a negative integer and 'b' as a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method works correctly with a negative and a positive integer. The expected result is the sum of the integers.

Scenario 5: Test getSum when 'a' and 'b' are zero.

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithZeros
  Description: The test is meant to verify the correct computation of the getSum method when both 'a' and 'b' are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize 'a' and 'b' as zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method works correctly when both 'a' and 'b' are zero. The expected result is zero as the sum of zeros is zero.
