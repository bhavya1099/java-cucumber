ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getSum_61f2af7779
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d
Scenario 1: Test when both a and b are zero
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfZeroes.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns zero when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of zero and zero is zero. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns the correct result for this edge case.
Scenario 2: Test when a is positive and b is negative
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveAndNegative.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns the correct result when a is positive and b is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a to a positive number and b to a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is the difference between a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a positive number and a negative number is the difference between the two numbers. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns the correct result for this scenario.
Scenario 3: Test when both a and b are positive
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositives.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns the correct result when both a and b are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b to positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two positive numbers is a positive number. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns the correct result for this scenario.
Scenario 4: Test when both a and b are negative
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegatives.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns the correct result when both a and b are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b to negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two negative numbers is a negative number. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns the correct result for this scenario.
Scenario 5: Test when a is positive and b is zero
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveAndZero.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns the correct result when a is positive and b is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a to a positive number and b to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is a.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a positive number and zero is the positive number. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns the correct result for this edge case.
