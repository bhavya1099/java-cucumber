Scenario 1: Verify the sum of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: getSumOfPositiveNumbers.
  Description: The getSum method is called with two positive numbers. The test verifies if the method correctly adds the two numbers and returns the proper result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a with a positive number and b with a positive number.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The returned value should be the sum of the two positive numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is based on the inherent property of addition. This test ensures basic functionality of the getSum method.
Scenario 2: Verify the sum of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: getSumOfNegativeNumbers.
  Description: The getSum method is called with two negative numbers. The test checks if the method correctly adds the two numbers and returns the correct result ( which would be a negative number)
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a with a negative number and b with a negative number.
  Act: Call the getSum method.
  Assert: The return value should be the sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is based on the inherent property of addition. This test checks if the getSum method can handle and return negative numbers correctly.
Scenario 3: Verify the sum of a positive number and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: getSumOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers.
  Description: The getSum method is called with a positive and a negative number. This test verifies whether the method correctly adds the two numbers and returns the right result.
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a with a positive number and b with a negative number.
   Act: Call the getSum method.
   Assert: The returned value should be the result of adding the positive and negative numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the getSum method accurately adds a positive and a negative integer. The expected result is based on the inherent property of addition. This test examines the proper functionality of getSum method when mixed inputs are given.
Scenario 4: Verify the sum of zero and any number
Details:
  TestName: getSumWithZero.
  Description: The getSum method is called with zero and another number. The test checks if the method returns the number when added with zero
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a with zero and b with any number.
   Act: Call the getSum method.
   Assert: The returned value should be the number other than zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getSum properly adds zero and another number. The expected result is based on the inherent property of addition. This test ensures that the getSum method treats zero as a neutral element in addition.
