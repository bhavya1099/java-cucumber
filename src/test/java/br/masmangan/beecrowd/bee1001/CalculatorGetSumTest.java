ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getSum_61f2af7779
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d
Scenario 1: Test when both a and b are zero
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfZeroes.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method returns zero when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of zero and zero is zero. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles and returns correct results for edge cases.
Scenario 2: Test when a and b are positive integers.
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveIntegers.
  Description: This test checks if the getSum method correctly sums up two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b with positive integer values.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result equals the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two positive integers is correctly computed. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.
Scenario 3: Test when a and b are negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegativeIntegers.
  Description: This test checks if the getSum method correctly sums up two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a and b with negative integer values.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result equals the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of two negative integers is correctly computed. This test is significant as it checks if the method can handle negative numbers.
Scenario 4: Test when a is a positive integer and b is a negative integer.
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfPositiveAndNegativeIntegers.
  Description: This test checks if the getSum method correctly sums up a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a with a positive integer and b with a negative integer.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result equals the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a positive and a negative integer is correctly computed. This test is significant as it checks if the method correctly handles different signs.
Scenario 5: Test when a is a negative integer and b is a positive integer.
Details:
  TestName: testSumOfNegativeAndPositiveIntegers.
  Description: This test checks if the getSum method correctly sums up a negative integer and a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a with a negative integer and b with a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result equals the sum of a and b.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sum of a negative and a positive integer is correctly computed. This test is significant as it checks if the method correctly handles different signs.
