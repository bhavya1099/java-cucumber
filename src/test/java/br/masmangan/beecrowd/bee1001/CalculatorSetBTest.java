================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: If your class or system takes user input and processes it further without validating or sanitizing, this can lead to various types of vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement appropriate input validation and sanitize all user input. Validate input for length, type, syntax, and business rules before consuming in the system.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Issue: If your application uses objects directly to perform operations on user-specified inputs, exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized data access.
Solution: Instead of direct object references, use indirect object references. Implement access controls to ensure users only access objects/data they are permitted to.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: If a system exposes sensitive information in error messages or in debugging information, it can be exploited by the attackers to gain more knowledge about the system.
Solution: Mask or remove all sensitive data from response outputs, error messages, and debugging information. Implement proper exception handling.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: CorrectInputIsBeingSet
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectInputIsBeingSet
  Description: This test is meant to validate if the method correctly sets the input 'b' to the class field 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as we are testing a simple setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with a valid integer.
    Assert: Using a getter method(if available) for 'b', assert that the value of 'b' is equal to the value you set.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setter method correctly assigns the value. It ensures that the application is maintaining state accurately.

Scenario 2: ExtremePositiveValueIsBeingSet
Details:
  TestName: testExtremePositiveValueIsBeingSet
  Description: This test is used to check if the method can handle setting large positive integer values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as we are testing a simple setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with a large positive integer (e.g. Max Integer Value).
    Assert: Using a getter method(if available) for 'b', assert that the value of 'b' is equal to the large positive value you set.
  Validation:
    This test verifies whether the method can handle the limit case of receiving the maximum value for an integer. It checks if the application handles edge cases appropriately.

Scenario 3: ExtremeNegativeValueIsBeingSet
Details:
  TestName: testExtremeNegativeValueIsBeingSet
  Description: This test is to confirm if the method can handle setting large negative integer values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as we are testing a simple setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with a large negative integer(e.g. Min Integer Value).
    Assert: Using a getter method(if available) for 'b', assert that the value of 'b' is equal to the large negative value you set.
  Validation:
    This test validates whether the method can handle the limit case of receiving the minimum value for an integer. It ensures that the application is resilient in the face of edge case scenarios.

Note :
  As the method being tested is a simple setter method with no conditions or exceptions, there are not many scenarios to test. The given scenarios cover all cases for this method.
