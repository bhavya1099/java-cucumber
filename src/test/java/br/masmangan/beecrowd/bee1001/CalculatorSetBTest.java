"""
Scenario 1: Validate setting a positive value to 'b'
TestName: testSettingPositiveValueToB
Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB() correctly sets a positive integer value to the private field 'b'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and a positive integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setB() method with the positive integer as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the expected positive integer.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB() method correctly sets the private field 'b' to the provided positive integer. If the assertion is true, it signifies that the method works as expected for positive values.
Scenario 2: Validate setting a negative value to 'b'
TestName: testSettingNegativeValueToB
Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB() correctly sets a negative integer value to the private field 'b'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and a negative integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setB() method with the negative integer as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the expected negative integer.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB() method correctly sets the private field 'b' to the provided negative integer. If the assertion is true, it signifies that the method works as expected for negative values.
Scenario 3: Validate setting zero to 'b'
TestName: testSettingZeroToB
Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB() correctly sets the value of 'b' to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setB() method with zero as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB() method correctly sets the private field 'b' to zero. If the assertion is true, it signifies that the method works as expected when setting 'b' to zero.
Scenario 4: Validate setting maximum integer value to 'b'
TestName: testSettingMaxIntToB
Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB() correctly sets the maximum integer value to the private field 'b'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and the maximum integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setB() method with the maximum integer value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the expected maximum integer value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB() method correctly sets the private field 'b' to the maximum integer value. If the assertion is true, it signifies that the method correctly handles the edge case of maximum integer values.
Scenario 5: Validate setting minimum integer value to 'b'
TestName: testSettingMinIntToB
Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB() correctly sets the minimum integer value to the private field 'b'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and the minimum integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setB() method with the minimum integer value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the expected minimum integer value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB() method correctly sets the private field 'b' to the minimum integer value. If the assertion is true, it signifies that the method correctly handles the edge case of minimum integer values.
