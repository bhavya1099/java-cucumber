Scenario 1: Normal Assignment

Details:
  TestName: normalSetB
  Description: Test to check if the normal assignment is working correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class object with arbitrary data and a distinct initial value of b.
  Act: Use the setB method to change the value of b.
  Assert: Retrieve the updated value of b using public getter (if exist) or reflection and compare it against the new value used in setB.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the setter method updated the value of b. The specific data and initial value of b are not a concern â€“ the primary focus is whether setB changes the field value correctly. This validates the basic function of the setter method.

Scenario 2: Assignment Edge Case (Maximum Value)

Details:
  TestName: maximumSetB
  Description: Test to check how the method reacts to the maximum value of int (Integer.MAX_VALUE).

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class object with arbitrary data.
  Act: Use the setB method to assign the maximum value of int to b.
  Assert: Retrieve the updated value of b and compare it to Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setB method can handle the maximum value of the int data type and acts appropriately. This ensures that the function can handle edge cases related to the data type of the field.

Scenario 3: Assignment Edge Case (Minimum Value)

Details:
  TestName: minimumSetB
  Description: Test to check how the setter reacts to the minimum value of int (Integer.MIN_VALUE).

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class object with arbitrary data.
  Act: Use the setB method to assign the minimum value of int to b.
  Assert: Retrieve the updated value of b and compare it to Integer.MIN_VALUE.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the setB method can handle the minimum value of the int data type and acts appropriately, ensuring that the function handles edge cases related to the data type of the field.

Scenario 4: Concurrent Assignment

Details:
  TestName: concurrentSetB
  Description: Test to check that the setB method can handle concurrent assignments from multiple threads.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class object with arbitrary data and start multiple threads.
  Act: Each thread should try to call the setB method at the same or close times.
  Assert: It is not necessary to assert any specific value as a result of the concurrent assignment, the crucial part is that no exception or error is thrown in the process.

Validation:
  The test verifies that the setB method is able to handle concurrent assignments (thread-safety). This check is significant in multithreaded applications where the same object could be accessed and modified by different threads at the same time.
