"""
Scenario 1: Test for successful product calculation
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulProductCalculation
  Description: This test is used to verify if the method getProduct correctly multiplies the two private integer variables a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign specific non-zero integral values to a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned product matches the expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method getProduct is correctly calculating the product. In the context of application behavior, this test ensures that the multiplication logic of the method, which might be significant to various computational tasks in the application, is correctly implemented.
"""
"""
Scenario 2: Test for multiplication by zero
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyByZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the case where one of the private variables a or b is zero, since anything multiplied by zero equals zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign 0 as the value to either a or b.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm if the returned product is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that zero multiplication logic is implemented correctly in getProduct method. This scenario is essential in programs where the possibility of a or b being zero exists, rendering the multiplication operation redundant and directly returning zero as the result without any errors.
"""
"""
Scenario 3: Test for multiplication of negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test aims to check the scenario where a and b are negative integers, since the multiplication of two negative numbers equals a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign negative values for a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned product is a positive integer.
Validation:
  This assertion ascertains that the logic for multiplying negative integers in getProduct method is correctly implemented, which is critically important to preserve the mathematical integrity of the application logic.
"""
"""
Scenario 4: Test for multiplication involving large numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies the scenario where a and b are large integers, simulating Overflow condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign large values to a and b that could potentially exceed the maximum limit of an integer.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to catch an ArithmeticException or any unexpected behavior.
Validation:
  This assertion is crucial to ensure the method handles large numbers within the constraints of the integer data type limit. It alerts developers to potential overflows that could lead to inaccurate computations or even application crashes.
