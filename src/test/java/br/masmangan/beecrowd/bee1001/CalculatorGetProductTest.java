"""
Scenario 1: Validate the method getProduct with positive integers

Details:
  TestName: testProductOfPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product of two positive integers are calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the instance variables a and b to positive integers(any integers greater than zero)
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result, which should be the multiplication of the two integers.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product calculation in the getProduct method is done correctly when positive integers are used. The expected result is based on the rule of multiplication of positive integers. It would validate if the method can handle normal happy-path cases.

Scenario 2: Validate the method getProduct with negative integers

Details:
  TestName: testProductOfNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product of two negative integers are calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the instance variables a and b to negative integers (any integers less than zero)
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result, which should be the multiplication of the two integers.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product calculation in the getProduct method is done correctly when negative integers are used. The expected result is based on the rule of multiplication of negative integers where multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number. It would validate if the method can handle negative input values.

Scenario 3: Validate the method getProduct with zero value integers

Details:
  TestName: testProductOfZeroValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product of a zero integer and another integer (zero or non-zero) are calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one instance variable(a or b) to zero and the other to any integer (zero or non-zero)
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result, which should be zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product calculation in the getProduct method is done correctly when one of the integers is zero. The expected result is based on the rule of multiplication where multiplication of any number by zero results in zero. It would validate if the method can handle these special cases.

Scenario 4: Validate the method getProduct with maximum integer values

Details:
  TestName: testProductOfMaxIntValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product of maximum integers are calculated without causing any overflow error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the instance variables a and b to Integer.MAX_VALUE
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: The test would expect an assertion error as the product of two maximum integer values would exceed the maximum limit of an integer in Java.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product calculation in the getProduct method doesn't overflow when maximum integer values are used. It would validate if the method can handle these edge cases.
