ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getProduct_630a0cff5b
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithPositiveNumbers.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getProduct correctly calculates the product of two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of a and b to any positive integer.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected product.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the product of two positive numbers. The expected result is the multiplication of the two numbers, which is the basic functionality of the method.
Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithNegativeNumbers.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getProduct correctly calculates the product of two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of a and b to any negative integer.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected product.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the product of two negative numbers. The expected result is a positive number, as the product of two negative numbers is positive.
Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithZero.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getProduct correctly calculates the product when one or both of the numbers is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of a or b (or both) to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected product.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the product when one or both of the numbers is zero. The expected result is zero, as the product of any number with zero is zero.
Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithMaxInt.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getProduct handles integer overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of a and b to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Check if an ArithmeticException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles integer overflow. The expected result is an ArithmeticException, as the product of two maximum integers will exceed the maximum integer value in Java.
