================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uninitialized Variables - CWE-457
Issue: The variables 'a' and 'b' in 'getProduct()' method are not initialized which leads to unpredictable results or undefined states in program execution.
Solution: Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use. Adding a constructor to initialize 'a' and 'b' would mitigate this issue.

Vulnerability: Inappropriate Operation on Non-validated Inputs - CWE-807
Issue: The getProduct() method performs a multiplication operation directly on 'a' and 'b' without verifying their values. This can lead potential code injection, buffer overflow or unexpected program behavior.
Solution: Validate all inputs to ensure they are within expected ranges and types. Defensive coding measures such as checking for null or extreme values should be implemented.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive value input test
Details:
  TestName: testPositiveValueInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method with positive values for both a and b variables.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the values of a and b to positive integers.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Assert the result should be the multiplication of both positive integers.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method behaves correctly with positive value input. If a and b are positive integers, the product should also be a positive integer according to multiplication rules.

Scenario 2: Negative value input test
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValueInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method with negative values for both a and b variables.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the values of a and b to negative integers.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Assert that the result is a positive integer (since the multiplication of two negative values results in a positive value).
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method behaves correctly with negative value input. It ensures that the method correctly handles multiplication rules for negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Zero value input test
Details:
  TestName: testZeroValueInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method with zero value for either a or b variables and a random integer for the other.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of a or b to 0, and the other to any random number.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Assert that the result is 0, as any number multiplied by 0 equals 0.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method behaves correctly when one of the inputs is zero. This tests for the scenario whether multiplication rules hold for multiplying by zero.

Scenario 4: Mixed value input test
Details:
  TestName: testMixedValueInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method with mixed inputs (one positive, one negative).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set values of a and b to be a positive and a negative integer respectively.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Assert that the result is a negative integer, as multiplying a positive number by a negative number equals a negative number.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method behaves correctly with mixed inputs. This validates that multiplication rules for mixed positive and negative values are correctly implemented.
