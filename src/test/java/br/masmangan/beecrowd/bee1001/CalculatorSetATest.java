================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Data Binding
Issue: If the 'a' variable's value is sourced from untrusted input or data, publicly accessible setters can inadvertently expose sensitive information or enable unwanted data modification.
Solution: To prevent these issues, one could implement checks for allowed values in the setter, or completely encapsulate the 'a' variable by making it private and only allowing controlled exposure through getter and setter methods.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: If the 'a' variable is initialized with a large value, it can lead to excessive use of memory resources which can slow down or crash the program if not handled correctly
Solution: Use a validation logic inside the method to check for maximum allowed value for 'a'. If the input exceeds the limit, throw an exception or error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive Integer Input Test
Details:
  TestName: setAPositiveInputTest
  Description: The test is meant to verify the setA method with a positive integer.
  Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement requires as there is no dependency.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with a positive integer i.e., 200.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion assertEquals to compare actual object's 'a' property against 200.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the method setA properly sets the object's property 'a' when provided with a positive integer. If the test passes, it proves the method can handle and correctly process the positive integer input.

Scenario 2: Negative Integer Input Test
Details:
  TestName: setANegativeInputTest
  Description: The test is designed to validate if the setA method can handle negative integer inputs.
  Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as there is no dependency.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with a negative integer i.e., -100.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion assertEquals to compare the actual object's 'a' property against -100.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the setA method can handle and correctly process negative integer inputs. If the test passes, it proves the method's capability to correctly set the property 'a' with a negative integer.

Scenario 3: Zero Input Test
Details:
  TestName: setAZeroInputTest
  Description: The test is meant to check if the setA method can handle zero as an input.
  Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as there is no dependency.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with zero as the input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion assertEquals to compare the actual object's 'a' property against 0.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the setA method correctly sets the object's 'a' property when provided with zero. If the test passes, it indicates the method's robustness to handle different integer inputs including zero.

Scenario 4: Maximum Integer Test
Details:
  TestName: setAMaxIntTest
  Description: The test is to verify if the setA method can handle the maximum integer input (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
  Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as no dependency.
  Act: Call the setA method with Integer.MAX_VALUE as the input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion assertEquals to compare the object's 'a' property against Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the setA method can handle the scenario when the input is maximum integer allowable. If this test passes, it assures the capability of the method to handle edge case of maximum limit of an integer.

Scenario 5: Minimum Integer Test
Details:
  TestName: setAMinIntTest
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setA method can handle the minimum integer input (Integer.MIN_VALUE).
  Execution:
  Arrange: No preparatory steps needed.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with Integer.MIN_VALUE as the input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion assertEquals to compare the object's 'a' property against Integer.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the setA method can handle the scenario when the input is the minimum integer allowable. If this test passes, it validates the method's ability to handle edge case of minimum limit of an integer.
