================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The provided code sample doesn't include any debug statements, however, leaving debug code in an application might expose sensitive information and could be used by an attacker to understand the application logic.
Solution: Always make sure to remove debug statements before building the production version of the java application. Code reviews can help to detect any leftover debug code.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Though not applicable to this code directly, GET requests in Java can sometimes expose sensitive information if proper care is not taken. If sensitive data such as password, session token etc. are passed, it can be easily exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Always use POST request while sending sensitive information to the server or as an alternative encrypt GET parameters. Care should also be taken not to expose implementation details in error messages or verbose logging.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Error Message Information Leakage
Issue: Though not applicable to this code directly, Error messages in Java applications can sometimes leak information about the internal working of the application, which an attacker might use to exploit the system.
Solution: Ensure that your error handling does not reveal detailed system information, stack traces, or debugging details that can help an attacker. Use a catch block to handle all types of exceptions and provide only the required important messages to the user.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Correct Message
Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnsCorrectMessage
  Description: This test will validate that the sayHello method returns the correct greetings message, which is "Hello World!".
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Verify that the return message from sayHello() method matches the string "Hello World!".
Validation:
  This assertion checks whether the "sayHello" method returns "Hello World!". This is the expected result as per the business requirement of our application greeting the user.

Scenario 2: Not null message Test
Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnsNonNullMessage.
  Description: This test will check that the sayHello method does not return a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the sayHello method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Assert that the return message from the sayHello() is not null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks whether the "sayHello" method does not return null. It's crucial to ensure that our application does not experience null pointer exceptions during execution.

Scenario 3: Test for Message Type
Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnsStringType.
  Description: This test will validate that the sayHello method returns a result of type String.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the sayHello method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned message from the sayHello() is an instance of a String.
Validation:
  This assertion checks whether the "sayHello" method returns a String type object. This is essential because our application may depend on this design contract where a specific type must be returned.
