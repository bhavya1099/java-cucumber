Scenario 1: Test for Calculation of Area with Valid radius Value

Details:
  TestName: testCalculationWithValidRadius.
  Description: This test checks if the method returns accurate area calculation for a given radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a known radius value.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: The returned area value should be equal to the expected value as per the mathematical formula.
Validation:
  Asserting aims to verify that the calculation of area is working correctly with valid inputs. It ensures that the core functionality of calculating area as per the formula is implemented correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for Calculation of Area with Zero radius value

Details:
  TestName: testCalculationWithZeroRadius.
  Description: This test intends to validate the function's output when the radius is set to zero, in which case the area should also be zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set radius value to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: Expect "0" as the area value.
Validation:
  Validates that getArea function returns 0 when radius is set to 0. Ensuring that the function handles such corner case and maintains the mathematical integrity is significant.

Scenario 3: Test for Calculation of Area with Negative radius value

Details:
  TestName: testCalculationWithNegativeRadius.
  Description: This test aims to verify the system response when the radius is set to negative. The behavior in this case depends on the functional requirements, which need to clarify how to handle such input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set radius value to a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: According to mathematical concept the area can't be negative so it should throw an appropriate error or return a specific message.
Validation:
  Validates that getArea function handles the edge case of negative radius input correctly, either by providing an error message or another predetermined response. This is important because it demonstrates the reliability of the function even in unfavorable situations.

Note: As the code to handle negative inputs is not present in the provided method, the actual behavior has to be analyzed based on the functional requirements and application behavior.
