"""
Scenario 1: Testing to assert the edge case of radius equal to zero
Details:
  TestName: testAreaWithRadiusOfZero.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getArea method when the radius equals zero. The mathematical principle states that the area of a circle with radius zero should also be zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set radius to zero.
    Act: invoke getArea method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcome (0).
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the edge case of radius zero, as any circle with radius zero must have an area of zero too.

Scenario 2: Testing to assert when the radius is a positive number
Details:
  TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getArea method calculates the area of a circle with a positive radius value, confirming that it follows the formula PI*radius*radius.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set radius to a positive number, e.g., 5.
    Act: invoke getArea method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcome, i.e., PI*25.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if a given circle's area is correctly calculated based on its radius, as this forms the core functionality of the method in application behavior.

Scenario 3: Testing to assert when the radius is a negative number
Details:
  TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius.
  Description: This test is meant to challenge how the getArea method handles a negative radius, in this context, we assume a negative radius is physically impossible and thus it should cause an error or return a specific value (like NaN).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set radius to a negative number, e.g., -5.
    Act: invoke getArea method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to catch the specific exception or to compare the actual results against expected outcome (NaN or similar).
  Validation:
    Checks whether the method handles physically impossible scenarios correctly. Depending on application behavior in such conditions, it could be important for avoiding crashes or undefined behavior.
