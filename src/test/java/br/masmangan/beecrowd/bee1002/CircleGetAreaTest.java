Scenario 1: Test for Positive Radius Value

Details:
   TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius.
   Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the getArea method for a positive radius value.
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a positive radius, such as 5.
   Act: Invoke the getArea method with the defined positive radius.
   Assert: Multiply the radius with itself, then multiply it by PI. The result should be the same as the output of the getArea method.
Validation:
   This verifies that the getArea method correctly computes the area of a circle given a positive radius. This is essential for accurate computation of the circle areas in the application.


Scenario 2: Test for Negative Radius Value

Details:
   TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius.
   Description: This test is designed to confirm that the getArea method handles negative radius values appropriately.
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a negative radius, such as -5.
   Act: Invoke the getArea method with the defined negative radius.
   Assert: Check if an exception or error has been thrown.
Validation:
   This confirms that the method validates input data by rejecting negative radius values. In reality, a circle can't have a negative radius; hence, this is essential for maintaining data integrity.


Scenario 3: Test for Zero Radius Value

Details:
   TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius.
   Description: This test verifies the getArea method's behavior when the radius value is zero.
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a radius of zero.
   Act: Invoke the getArea method with the defined zero radius.
   Assert: The result should be 0, as any number multiplied by zero is zero.
Validation:
   This checks if the getArea method appropriately handles scenarios where the radius is zero. This is significant in maintaining accurate area computation when the circle has no radius.


Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Positive Radius Value

Details:
   TestName: testAreaWithMaxPositiveRadius.
   Description: This test is aimed at confirming that the getArea method can handle and correctly compute the area of very large circles.
Execution:
   Arrange: Initialize a radius with the largest positive value possible.
   Act: Invoke the getArea method with the defined maximum positive radius.
   Assert: Multiply the radius with itself, then multiply it by PI. The result should be the same as the output of the getArea method.
Validation:
   This validates if the getArea method can handle large-radius circles, essential for maintaining correct area calculations for any circle size within the range of practical applications.
