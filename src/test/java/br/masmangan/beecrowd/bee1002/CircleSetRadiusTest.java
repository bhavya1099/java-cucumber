================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: If user-submitted data is passed to the setRadius method without proper validation, it might cause unexpected behavior. For example, if a negative value or a too large value is passed, it might result in processing errors or memory overflow issues.
Solution: To mitigate, it's advisable to add checks validating the input range before setting the radius. This would ensure the value is within expected boundaries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for zero radius value

Details:
    TestName: setZeroRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setRadius can handle a scenario in which the radius is set to zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a value of 0.
    Act: Call setRadius method with the variable.
    Assert: Assert that the method correctly sets the radius value to 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle zero values correctly. It's necessary in the context of the application behavior because having a radius of 0 is a possible scenario.

Scenario 2: Valid positive radius value

Details:
    TestName: setPositiveRadius
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the method setRadius can handle a valid positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a positive number like 5.0.
    Act: Call setRadius method with this variable.
    Assert: Assert that the method correctly sets the variable to the value provided.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the setRadius method handles positive numbers correctly and sets radius value accurately as provided. This is significant as radius is often a positive number.

Scenario 3: Valid negative radius value

Details:
    TestName: setNegativeRadius
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the setRadius method can handle a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a negative number like -5.0.
    Act: Call setRadius method with this variable.
    Assert: Assert that the method sets this negative value correctly.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the setRadius method handles negative numbers correctly. As normally radius can't be a negative number but the method should not crash it should handle it, it articulates the stability of method execution.

Scenario 4: Large radius value

Details:
    TestName: setLargeRadiusValue
    Description: The test is meant to check if the method setRadius can handle large radius values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a large number like 999999.0.
    Act: Call setRadius method with this large number.
    Assert: Assert the method sets the large radius value accurately.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims at verifying that the method can accept large numbers without crashing or behaving unexpectedly. This is a performance and stability test for the setRadius method.
