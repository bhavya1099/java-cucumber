1) Scenario 1: Test The Normal Range For Radius

  Details:
    TestName: testNormalRangeForRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method in a normal range, for example radius = 5.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the object of the class, and set radius as 5.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with radius set to 5.
    Assert: Assert that the radius of the object is 5.
  Validation:
    Verification is aimed at confirming that the method correctly sets the radius in the normal range. The expected result (radius equals 5) is due to our specific input in this scenario.

2) Scenario 2: Test the Maximum For Radius

  Details:
    TestName: testMaximumForRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method for the maximum valid radius value, such as Double.MAX_VALUE.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the object of the class, and set radius as Double.MAX_VALUE.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with radius set to Double.MAX_VALUE.
    Assert: Assert that the radius of the object is equal to Double.MAX_VALUE.
  Validation:
    Verification is aimed at confirming that the method correctly handles the highest possible input, helping to establish the upper limit of this method's functional scope.

3) Scenario 3: Test the Minimum For Radius

  Details:
    TestName: testMinimumForRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method for the minimum valid radius value, for instance 0 or negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the object of the class, and set radius as 0.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the radius set to 0.
    Assert: Assert that the radius of the object is equal to 0.
  Validation:
    Verification is aimed at confirming whether the method correctly handles the lowest possible input, i.e., zero. This test helps establish the lower limit of this method's functional scope.

4) Scenario 4: Test Invalid Inputs For Radius

  Details:
    TestName: testInvalidInputsForRadius
    Description: This test is set to check if the setRadius method can handle invalid radius values such as NaN and infinite values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise the object of the class, and set radius as NaN or Infinity.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with invalid radius.
    Assert: Expect an assertion error.
  Validation:
    The verification is aimed to confirm that the method correctly handles exceptional scenarios and does not permit an invalid radius value entry. This helps to ensure the robustness of the code.
