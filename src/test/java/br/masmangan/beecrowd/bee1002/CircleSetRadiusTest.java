"""
Scenario 1: Value is Positive
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveRadius
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function setRadius correctly sets the radius when provided with a positive value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to set up any data as the method is just a setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with a positive value parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the radius instance variable to the positive value used as a parameter.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the instance variable radius has been successfully set to the positive value. This is important as setting the radius is a critical functionality of this method.

Scenario 2: Value is Zero
Details:
  TestName: setZeroRadius
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function setRadius correctly sets the radius when provided with a zero value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to set up any data as the method is just a setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with a zero value parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the radius instance variable to the zero value used as a parameter.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the instance variable radius has been successfully set to zero. This is important as setting the radius is a critical functionality of this method and it should be able to handle a zero value.

Scenario 3: Value is Negative
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeRadius
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function setRadius handles incorrect inputs like negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to set up any data as the method is just a setter method.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with a negative value parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the radius instance variable to the negative value used as a parameter.
  Validation:
    If the implementation does not allow a negative radius, the assertion could fail, indicating an exception or error should be thrown. If there is no such restriction, the negative value should be set as the radius.
