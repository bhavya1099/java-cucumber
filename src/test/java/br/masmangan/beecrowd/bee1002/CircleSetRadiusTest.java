Scenario 1: Test when radius is positive number

Details:
  TestName: testWhenRadiusIsPositive
  Description: This test will verify if the method correctly sets the radius when a positive value is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required in this case as we do not have dependencies.
  Act: Invoke setRadius with a positive number.
  Assert: Invoke getRadius method and check if the returned value is same as the one set.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the setRadius method correctly sets the radius when a positive number is passed. This test ensures that the functionality behaves as expected in normal circumstances.

Scenario 2: Test when radius is zero

Details:
  TestName: testWhenRadiusIsZero
  Description: This test checks how the method handles the scenario when the radius is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required in this case as we do not have dependencies.
  Act: Invoke setRadius with zero.
  Assert: Invoke getRadius method and check if the returned value is same as the one set.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the setRadius method correctly handles the edge case when a radius of zero is passed. This test ensures that the functionality behaves as expected in edge case scenario.

Scenario 3: Test when radius is a negative number

Details:
  TestName: testWhenRadiusIsNegative
  Description: This test checks how the method handles the scenario when the radius is set to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required in this case as we do not have dependencies.
  Act: Invoke setRadius with a negative number.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the right exception is thrown when radius is negative. This is important because a radius cannot be a negative number, and thus the method should handle this error appropriately.

Scenario 4: Test when radius is a very large number

Details:
  TestName: testWhenRadiusIsVeryLargeNumber
  Description: This test checks how the method handles the scenario when a very large number is set for the radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required in this case as we do not have dependencies.
  Act: Invoke setRadius with a very large number.
  Assert: Invoke getRadius method and check if the returned value is same as the one set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies if the setRadius method correctly handles the case when a very large number is set as the radius. This test is important to ensure that the method can handle extreme values correctly.
