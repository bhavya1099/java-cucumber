Scenario 1: Testing the method setC with positive value

Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithPositiveValue.
  Description: This test will validate if the method works correctly with positive values, and is setting this value in the 'c' attribute correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the containing class, but don't set the 'c' attribute.
    Act: Call the setC method with a positive double value as a parameter.
    Assert: Use the appropriate getter method or reflection to retrieve the new 'c' value, comparing it to the input value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the input value has correctly been set as the new 'c' attribute. If the values match, then the method is functioning as expected.


Scenario 2: Testing the method setC with negative value

Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithNegativeValue.
  Description: This test will validate if the method works correctly with negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the containing class, but don't set the 'c' attribute.
    Act: Call the setC method with a negative double value as a parameter.
    Assert: Use the appropriate getter method or reflection to retrieve the new 'c' value, comparing it to the input value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the input value has correctly been set as the new 'c' attribute. If the values match, then the method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 3: Testing the method setC with zero

Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithZero.
  Description: This test will validate if the method works correctly when passing zero as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the containing class, but don't set the 'c' attribute.
    Act: Call the setC method with zero as the parameter.
    Assert: Use the appropriate getter method or reflection to retrieve the new 'c' value, comparing it to zero.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the input value 'zero' has correctly been set as the new 'c' attribute. If the values match, then the method is functioning as expected.
