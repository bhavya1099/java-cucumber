================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method setC is public and sets the value of an internal variable. The value is not validated before it is set, meaning a user can set any value to it, even one causing unexpected behaviors.
Solution: Add validation checks to ensure the input being set to the field isn't malicious. If possible, leverage Java's built-in methods to sanitize and validate the input or use secure libraries like Apache Commons Validator.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Positive test case where set a regular number as C
  Details:
    TestName: testSetRegularNumberAsC
    Description: The test is designed to check whether the number can be set to double attribute 'c' successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a regular number such as 5.0.
    Act: Call setC(5.0).
    Assert: Assert that 'c' has been changed to 5.0.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that a regular number can be set to attribute c correctly. If the test passes, it means setC method can handle regular conditions without any problems.

  Scenario 2: Negative value as input for setC
  Details:
    TestName: testSetNegativeValueAsC
    Description: The test is to validate whether a negative value could be set as 'c'
    Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange a negative value like -7.0
    Act: Call setC(-7.0)
    Assert: Assert that 'c' has been changed to -7.0.
  Validation:
    This test will verify if the method handles negative inputs correctly, meaning the object allows negative values for its attribute 'c'.

  Scenario 3: Set zero as C
  Details:
    TestName: testSetZeroAsC
    Description: This test is to ensure that zero value can also be set to 'c'
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a zero value.
    Act: Invoke setC with 0.0.
    Assert: Assert that 'c' has been changed to 0.0.
  Validation:
    This ensures that attribute 'c' can take zero as a valid input successfully.

  Scenario 4: Nan as input for setC
  Details:
    TestName: testSetNanAsC
    Description: These tests verify that the setC method can handle NaN as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange a NaN.
    Act: Invoke setC(Double.NaN).
    Assert: Assert that 'c' is now NaN.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the method can handle NaN as input and does not throw an exception.
