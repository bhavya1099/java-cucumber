Scenario 1: Test when b is set to a regular positive number

Details:
  TestName: settingPositiveNumberToB
  Description: This test is meant to check if the value of b is set correctly when a positive number is used as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required as we're testing a setter.
    Act: Invoke setB with a positive number.
    Assert: Use the getter method for b to verify that its value matches the number used in the setB method.
  Validation:
    The assertion should verify that the correct value was set to variable b. This test is significant as it checks the proper functioning of the setB method with positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Test when b is set to zero

Details:
  TestName: settingZeroToB
  Description: This test is meant to check if the value of b is set correctly when zero is used as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required.
    Act: Invoke setB with zero.
    Assert: Use the getter method for b to verify that its value is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion should verify that the correct value was set to variable b. This test is important as it assesses the method's behavior with zero as input.

Scenario 3: Test when b is set to a regular negative number

Details:
  TestName: settingNegativeNumberToB
  Description: This test is intended to check if the value of b is correctly set when a negative number is used as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required.
    Act: Invoke setB with a negative number.
    Assert: Use the getter method for b to verify that its value matches the negative number used in the setB method.
  Validation:
    The assertion should confirm that the correct value was set to variable b. This test is crucial to ensure that the setB method works properly with negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Test when b is set to maximum double value

Details:
  TestName: settingMaxDoubleToB
  Description: This test is designed to check if the value of b is set correctly when the maximum possible double value is used as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required.
    Act: Invoke setB with the maximum possible double value.
    Assert: Use the getter method for b to verify that its value is the maximum possible double value.
  Validation:
    The assertion must verify that the correct value was set to variable b. This test is important as it tests the upper limit of the method's handling capacity.

  Scenario 5: Test when b is set to minimum double value

Details:
  TestName: settingMinDoubleToB
  Description: This test is designed to check if the value of b is set correctly when the minimum possible double value is used as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required.
    Act: Invoke setB with the minimum possible double value.
    Assert: Use the getter method for b to verify that its value is the minimum possible double value.
  Validation:
    The assertion must verify that the correct value was set to variable b. This test is important as it tests the lower limit of the method's handling capacity.
