 * """ Scenario 1: Testing the setB method with positive input Details: TestName:
 * testSetBWithPositiveNumber Description: This test is meant to check if the method
 * 'setB' properly sets the "b" field using a positive number as input. Execution:
 * Arrange: A positive number will be selected as input. Act: 'setB' method will be
 * invoked with the selected positive number. Assert: Assert that the "b" field is now
 * equivalent to the input positive number. Validation: This test is intended to verify
 * that 'setB' can successfully set field 'b' using positive number input. If the 'b'
 * field is equivalent to the input number, it can be concluded that 'setB' correctly set
 * the field when given a positive number.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Testing the setB method with negative input Details: TestName:
 * testSetBWithNegativeNumber Description: This test checks if the method 'setB' correctly
 * assigns a negative value to the "b" field. Execution: Arrange: A negative number will
 * be chosen as test input. Act: 'setB' method will be invoked with the selected negative
 * number. Assert: Assert that the "b" field is the same as the input negative number.
 * Validation: This test is meant to verify that 'setB' can properly assign field b with a
 * negative number.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Testing the setB method with zero input Details: TestName: testSetBWithZero
 * Description: This test is meant to verify if the method 'setB' correctly sets the 'b'
 * field with zero as input. Execution: Arrange: Zero will be selected as test input. Act:
 * 'setB' method will be invoked with zero. Assert: Assert that 'b' field is zero.
 * Validation: This test is meant to confirm if 'setB' correctly sets 'b' field with zero
 * as it's a valid real number.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Testing the setB method with maximum allowed double value Details:
 * TestName: testSetBWithMaxDouble Description: This test is designed to determine whether
 * the 'setB' method correctly sets the 'b' field using the maximum allowed double value
 * as an input. Execution: Arrange: The maximum allowed double value will be chosen as the
 * input. Act: The 'setB' method will be invoked with the maximum allowed double value.
 * Assert: Assert that the "b" field is now equivalent to the maximum allowed double
 * value. Validation: We're verifying whether 'setB' can handle the maximum allowed double
 * value. If it sets the field 'b' accurately, it means 'setB' is optimized for maximum
 * value input.
 *
 * Scenario 5: Testing the setB method with minimum allowed double value Details:
 * TestName: testSetBWithMinDouble Description: This test is designed to determine whether
 * 'setB' method correctly sets the 'b' field using the minimum allowed double value as an
 * input. Execution: Arrange: Minimum allowed double value will be selected as the input.
 * Act: 'setB' method will be invoked with the minimum allowed double value. Assert:
 * Assert that the "b" field is now equivalent to the minimum allowed double value.
 * Validation: This test aims to confirm if 'setB' can handle the minimum allowed double
 * value. If successful, it demonstrates its efficiency and accuracy at system boundaries.
