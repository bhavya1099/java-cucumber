================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Sent Data (CWE-201)
Issue: The variable 'a' is set via the method 'setA'. If the variable 'a' contains sensitive information without encryption or sanitization, there will be a risk of data exposure.
Solution: Consider encrypting sensitive data before assigning it to 'a' or use methods that treat the information as sensitive, such as by sanitizing the data in memory when not in use.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Access (CWE-732)
Issue: The method 'setA' to modify the variable 'a' is publicly accessible which may allow an attacker to change the state of the object at will.
Solution: Adjust the method 'setA' access modifier to a more restricted level, such as 'private' or 'protected', according to the specific needs of your application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Setting 'a' to a positive value

Details:
  TestName: testSetAPositiveValue
  Description: This test will affirm that the method correctly assigns a positive numerical value to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is required as 'a' does not need a preliminary value.
  Act: Call setA with a positive value.
  Assert: Verify that 'a' now contains the given positive value.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms 'a' can be successfully assigned a positive value. This is vital because if a positive value can't be set, results will be inaccurate.

Scenario 2: Setting 'a' to a negative value

Details:
  TestName: testSetANegativeValue
  Description: This test will affirm that the method correctly assigns a negative numerical value to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is required as 'a' does not need a preliminary value.
  Act: Call setA with a negative value.
  Assert: Verify that 'a' now contains the given negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms 'a' can be successfully assigned a negative value. This is vital to ensure computational accuracy for calculations involving negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Setting 'a' to zero

Details:
  TestName: testSetAZeroValue
  Description: This test will affirm that the method correctly assigns zero to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is required as 'a' does not need a preliminary value.
  Act: Call setA with zero.
  Assert: Verify that 'a' now contains zero.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms 'a' can be successfully assigned a zero value. This is important as it verifies that 'a' will correctly hold and return the value of zero when needed.

Scenario 4: Setting 'a' to a decimal value

Details:
  TestName: testSetADecimalValue
  Description: This test will assert that setA correctly assigns a decimal value to 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is required as 'a' does not need a preliminary value.
  Act: Call setA with a decimal value.
  Assert: Verify that 'a' now contains the given decimal value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that it's possible to set 'a' to a decimal value. This is critical as it confirms the system can handle numerical operations that result in decimal values.

Scenario 5: Setting 'a' to a large value

Details:
  TestName: testSetALargeValue
  Description: This test will validate that the setA method can handle assigning large values to 'a' without crashing or causing an overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is required as 'a' does not need a preliminary value.
  Act: Call setA with a large numerical value.
  Assert: Check that 'a' now holds the large numerical value.
Validation:
  This affirms that the application can handle large numerical figures without breaking, which is crucial for performing high volume computations.
