Scenario 1: Normal usage test

Details:
  TestName: testNormalUsage.
  Description: This is a basic scenario where we pass a normal value to the setA method and check if it's correctly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method doesn't depend on any external data.
    Act: Call setA(2.0).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'a' is 2.0.
  Validation:
    The test verifies that 'a' is correctly set when a valid value is passed. This ensures that the basic functionality of setA method is working properly.

Scenario 2: Test with negative value

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValue.
  Description: This tests whether a negative value is correctly set to 'a'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method doesn't depend on any external data.
    Act: Call setA(-5.0).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'a' is -5.0.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that 'a' can handle negative values correctly. This is important as negative values could be a valid input for the application.

Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  TestName: testZeroValue.
  Description: This tests if zero is correctly set to 'a'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method doesn't depend on any external data.
    Act: Call setA(0.0).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'a' is 0.0.
  Validation:
    The test checks if 'a' can handle zero correctly. Being able to handle zero is a basic requirement for any numeric field.

Scenario 4: Test with maximum value(double)

Details:
  TestName: testMaxValue.
  Description: This tests if a maximum value(Double.MAX_VALUE) is correctly set to 'a'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method doesn't depend on any external data.
    Act: Call setA(Double.MAX_VALUE).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'a' is Double.MAX_VALUE.
  Validation:
    The test checks if 'a' can handle the maximum double value. While this is an extreme edge case , it validates that the field is robust to high inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with minimum value(double)

Details:
  TestName: testMinValue.
  Description: This tests if a minimum value(Double.MIN_VALUE) is correctly set to 'a'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method doesn't depend on any external data.
    Act: Call setA(Double.MIN_VALUE).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'a' is Double.MIN_VALUE.
  Validation:
    The test checks if 'a' can handle the minimum double value. This again ensures the robustness of the field to extreme low input values.
