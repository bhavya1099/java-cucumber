            The error message produced while running tests suggests the test class FractionalKnapsackFractionalKnapsackTest, "FractionalKnapsackTest", does not match with the filename. In Java, the file name and the  class FractionalKnapsackFractionalKnapsackTest it must have identical names. 
            
            Thus, the solution is to ensure that the file containing class "FractionalKnapsackTest" is named as "FractionalKnapsackTest.java". 
            
            The test cases do not need any modification as the error is not in the test logic but in the file structuring. All the tests are well covering different scenarios and edge cases. They have been coded correctly, with provisions for checking optimal increasing ratios, fractional parts, equal ratios, insufficient items, and empty or null parameters.
            
            This is an important Java compilation rule, and modifying it will solve the compiling error. Be sure to follow Java's naming conventions for classes and files for smooth code compiling and execution.
