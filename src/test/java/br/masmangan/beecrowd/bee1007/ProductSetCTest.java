Scenario 1: Test SetC method with valid integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithValidIntegerValue
  Description: This test is meant to validate the setc(int c) method with a valid integer value. The objective is to ensure that the method correctly updates the value of the 'c' field.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a valid integer value, for example, 10.
    Act: Call setC method with defined integer value.
    Assert: Check if the value of the 'c' field in the object is the same as the defined integer value.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed at verifying the proper assignment of the 'c' field. If the test passes, it confirms that the setC method correctly functions with valid integer values.
Scenario 2: Test SetC method with extreme positive integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithExtremePositiveIntegerValue
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the setC function can handle extreme integer positive values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set an extreme positive integer value, for instance, Integer.MAX_VALUE.
    Act: Call setC method with the defined integer value.
    Assert: Check if the 'c' field in the object is the same as the defined integer value.
  Validation:
    If the test passes, it validates that the setC method can handle and correctly function with extreme positive integer values.
Scenario 3: Test SetC method with extreme negative integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithExtremeNegativeIntegerValue
  Description: The test is meant to examine if the setC function can correctly handle extreme negative integer values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an extreme negative integer value, for example, Integer.MIN_VALUE.
    Act: Call setC method with the defined integer value.
    Assert: Check if the field 'c' in the object is the same as the defined integer value.
  Validation:
    If the test passes, it verifies that the setC method can handle and accurately function with extreme negative integer values.
Scenario 4: Test setC method with zero
Details:
  TestName: testSetCWithZero
  Description: The test aims to asses if the setC method correctly handles zero as an input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set zero as the value.
    Act: Call the setC method with the value zero.
    Assert: Check if the 'c' field in the object is the same as zero.
  Validation:
    The success of this test marks that the setC method accurately updates the 'c' value even when the input is zero.
