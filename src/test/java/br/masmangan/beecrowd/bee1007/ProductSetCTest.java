  Scenario 1: Test Product setC method with positive integer
-
    TestName: testSetCWithPositiveInteger
    Description: This test is to verify whether setC method is working correctly when given positive integer.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Initialize the Product entity and setC to a positive integer.
        Act: Invoke the setC and getDifference methods.
        Assert: Verify that the difference calculated by getDifference is as expected.
    Validation:
        This test verifies whether the setC method is able to handle and correctly set positive integer values. The expected behavior is that the method should set the product's record and return correct difference from getDifference method when a positive number is used as input.
  Scenario 2: Test Product setC method with negative integer
-
    TestName: testSetCWithNegativeInteger
    Description: This test is to verify whether setC method is working correctly when given negative integer.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Initialize the Product entity and setC to a negative integer.
        Act: Invoke the setC and getDifference methods.
        Assert: Verify that the difference calculated by getDifference is as expected.
    Validation:
        This test verifies whether the setC method is able to handle and correctly set negative integer values. The expected behavior is that the method should set the product's record and return correct difference from getDifference method when a negative number is used as input.
  Scenario 3: Test Product setC method with zero
-
    TestName: testSetCWithZero
    Description: This test is to verify whether setC method is working correctly when given zero as argument.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Initialize the Product entity and setC to zero.
        Act: Invoke the setC and getDifference methods.
        Assert: Verify that the difference calculated by getDifference is as expected.
    Validation:
        This test verifies whether the setC method is able to handle and correctly set the entity variable to zero. The expected behavior is that the method should set the product record to zero, and the getDifference method should return a correct result based on zero input.
