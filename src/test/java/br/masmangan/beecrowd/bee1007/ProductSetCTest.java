================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The 'setC' method allows for unvalidated value to be assigned. This can lead to a variety of security issues depending upon what 'c' is used for in the code base.
Solution: You might want to implement input validation within your setter method. Here's an example:

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Regular Input Test

  Details:
    TestName: testSetCWithRegularInput
    Description: This test checks whether the method correctly sets an integer value c.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup required.
    Act: Invoke the method setC with a regular value (for example, 5).
    Assert: Check whether the implemented class variable 'c' holds the same value by using getter method.
  Validation:
    This test validates the basic functionality of the setter method, setting the value of a variable. Passing if the value stored in 'c' is accurate, demonstrating that the method works correctly with regular integer input.

Scenario 2: Negative Input Test

  Details:
    TestName: testSetCWithNegativeInput
    Description: This test checks whether the setC method can correctly set a negative integer value to c.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup required.
    Act: Invoke the method setC with a negative value (for example, -7).
    Assert: Check whether the implemented class variable 'c' holds the same negative value by using getter method.
  Validation:
    The purpose of this test is to verify the behavior of the method when dealing with negative input values. Passing assert would mean the setter method works as expected even with negative values.

Scenario 3: Large Value Input Test

  Details:
    TestName: testSetCWithLargeValue
    Description: This test checks the behavior of setC when a very large positive number is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup required.
    Act: Invoke the method setC with a large value (for example, Integer.MAX_VALUE).
    Assert: Check whether the implemented class variable 'c' holds the same large value by using getter method.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the method can handle end-case scenarios like setting a very large integer value to c. If the assertion passes, it proves that the function can correctly handle large inputs.

Scenario 4: Zero Value Input Test

  Details:
    TestName: testSetCWithZero
    Description: This test checks the functionality of setC when zero is passed as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup required.
    Act: Invoke the method setC with zero.
    Assert: Check whether the implemented class variable 'c' holds the value zero by using getter method.
  Validation:
    This test validates the behavior of the method with zero input. Passing the test will confirm that the function can handle zero as an input and correctly sets the variable 'c' to zero.
