"Scenario 1: Test When All Variables Are Zero
Details:
TestName: testWhenAllVariablesAreZero
Description: This test is meant to check if the getDifference method returns zero when all variables are set to zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set variables a, b, c, and d to zero using the setters.
Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when all variables are zero. This test is significant as it verifies the method's functionality in a basic scenario.

Scenario 2: Test When Variables A and B are Greater Than C and D
Details:
TestName: testWhenAandBAreGreaterThanCandD
Description: This test is meant to check if the getDifference method returns a positive value when the product of a and b is greater than the product of c and d.
Execution:
Arrange: Set variables a, b, c, and d such that a*b > c*d using the setters.
Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is positive.
Validation:
The assertion is to verify that the method correctly calculates the difference when a*b > c*d. This test is significant as it verifies the method's functionality in a common scenario.

Scenario 3: Test When Variables C and D are Greater Than A and B
Details:
TestName: testWhenCandDAreGreaterThanAandB
Description: This test is meant to check if the getDifference method returns a negative value when the product of c and d is greater than the product of a and b.
Execution:
Arrange: Set variables a, b, c, and d such that c*d > a*b using the setters.
Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is negative.
Validation:
The assertion is to verify that the method correctly calculates the difference when c*d > a*b. This test is significant as it verifies the method's functionality in a common scenario.

Scenario 4: Test When Variables A, B, C, and D are Equal
Details:
TestName: testWhenAllVariablesAreEqual
Description: This test is meant to check if the getDifference method returns zero when all variables are equal.
Execution:
Arrange: Set variables a, b, c, and d to the same value using the setters.
Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when all variables are equal. This test is significant as it verifies the method's functionality in a specific scenario.

Scenario 5: Test When Variables A and B are Zero and C and D are Non-Zero
Details:
TestName: testWhenAandBAreZeroAndCandDAreNonZero
Description: This test is meant to check if the getDifference method returns a negative value when a and b are zero and c and d are non-zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set variables a and b to zero and c and d to non-zero values using the setters.
Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is negative.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when a and b are zero and c and d are non-zero. This test is significant as it verifies the method's functionality in a specific scenario.
