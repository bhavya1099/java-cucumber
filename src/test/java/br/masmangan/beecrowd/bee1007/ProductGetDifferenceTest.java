 **Scenario 1: Testing Positive Difference**
**Details:**
- TestName: positiveDifference
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's ability to calculate a positive difference between two given numbers.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = 10, b = 5, c = 2, d = 1.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 45.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (10 * 5) - (2 * 1) = 45.
- This test ensures that the method functions as expected when the difference is a positive value.
**Scenario 2: Testing Negative Difference**
**Details:**
- TestName: negativeDifference
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's ability to calculate a negative difference between two given numbers.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = 2, b = 1, c = 5, d = 10.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is -48.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (2 * 1) - (5 * 10) = -48.
- This test ensures that the method functions as expected when the difference is a negative value.
**Scenario 3: Testing Zero Difference**
**Details:**
- TestName: zeroDifference
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's behavior when the difference between (a * b) and (c * d) is zero.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = 4, b = 2, c = 8, d = 4.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 0.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (4 * 2) - (8 * 4) = 0.
- This test ensures that the method handles cases where the difference is zero.
**Scenario 4: Testing with Null Values**
**Details:**
- TestName: nullValues
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's behavior when one or more of the instance variables (a, b, c, d) are null.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = null, b = 5, c = 2, d = 1.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 0.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method handles null values by returning 0 when any of the instance variables are null.
- This test ensures that the method behaves gracefully in the presence of null values.
**Scenario 5: Testing with Negative Numbers**
**Details:**
- TestName: negativeNumbers
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's ability to calculate the difference correctly when one or more of the instance variables are negative.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = -10, b = 5, c = 2, d = -1.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is -45.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (-10 * 5) - (2 * -1) = -45.
- This test ensures that the method works correctly with negative numbers.
**Scenario 6: Testing with Large Numbers**
**Details:**
- TestName: largeNumbers
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's ability to handle large numbers without encountering integer overflow issues.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = 1000000, b = 500000, c = 2000000, d = 1000000.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 0.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (1000000 * 500000) - (2000000 * 1000000) = 0.
- This test ensures that the method handles large numbers without overflow issues.
**Scenario 7: Testing with Boundary Values**
**Details:**
- TestName: boundaryValues
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's behavior at the boundary values of integer data types.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = Integer.MAX_VALUE, b = Integer.MAX_VALUE, c = Integer.MIN_VALUE, d = Integer.MIN_VALUE.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 0.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method handles boundary values correctly by returning 0 when the difference between (a * b) and (c * d) is 0.
- This test ensures that the method behaves as expected at the limits of integer data types.
**Scenario 8: Testing with Equal Values**
**Details:**
- TestName: equalValues
**Description:**
- This test verifies the method's behavior when the values of a and c, and b and d are equal.
**Execution:**
- Arrange:
  - Set a = 10, b = 10, c = 10, d = 10.
- Act:
  - Invoke the getDifference() method with the above values.
- Assert:
  - Assert that the returned difference is 0.
**Validation:**
- The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference of (a * b) - (c * d), which in this case is (10 * 10) - (10 * 10) = 0.
- This test ensures that the method handles cases where the values of a and c, and b and d are equal.
