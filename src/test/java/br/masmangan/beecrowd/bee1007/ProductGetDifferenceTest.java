```plaintext
Scenario 1: Test with all positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAllPositiveNumbers
  Description: Validates the getDifference method when all input values (a, b, c, d) are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 2, b = 3, c = 1, d = 4.
  Act: Call the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 2 (as 2*3 - 1*4 = 6 - 4).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for the correct computation of the method under positive number conditions.
  The significance of this test is to confirm correct behavior when all inputs are positive, which is a common case in numerical operations.

Scenario 2: Test with all negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testAllNegativeNumbers
  Description: Validates the getDifference method when all input values (a, b, c, d) are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -2, b = -3, c = -1, d = -4.
  Act: Call the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -2 (as -2*-3 - -1*-4 = 6 - 4).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for the correct computation of the method under negative number conditions.
  It's important to test negative values to ensure that multiplication and subtraction are handled correctly with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with zeros
Details:
  TestName: testWithZeros
  Description: Validates the getDifference method when some input values are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 0, b = 3, c = 0, d = 4.
  Act: Call the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -0 (as 0*3 - 0*4 = 0 - 0).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method handles zero values correctly, ensuring no erroneous behavior in multiplication or subtraction.
  Testing with zeros is crucial as it can be a common edge case in mathematical computations.

Scenario 4: Test with mixed sign values
Details:
  TestName: testMixedSignValues
  Description: Checks the getDifference method when input values have mixed signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -2, b = 3, c = 1, d = -4.
  Act: Call the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 10 (as -2*3 - 1*-4 = -6 + 4).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion ensures proper handling of mixed sign multiplication and subtraction.
  This test is significant for verifying that the method behaves correctly under mixed sign conditions, which can be a realistic scenario in numerical operations.

Scenario 5: Test with large values
Details:
  TestName: testLargeValues
  Description: Validates the getDifference method when input values are very large to check for any overflow issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 10000, b = 30000, c = 10000, d = 40000.
  Act: Call the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -1000000000 (as 10000*30000 - 10000*40000 = 300000000 - 400000000).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for correct computation without overflow.
  This test is important to ensure that the method can handle large values without computational errors, which is crucial for applications dealing with high range numerical data.

/*
The failure of the test function `testAllNegativeNumbers` is due to a misunderstanding of the result from the `getDifference()` method when all input numbers are negative. The `getDifference()` method computes the difference as `a * b - c * d`. Given the values set in the test:

- `a = -2`
- `b = -3`
- `c = -1`
- `d = -4`

The multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number. Therefore, `a * b` equals `6` and `c * d` equals `4`. The method then computes `6 - 4`, which equals `2`.

However, the test asserts that the result should be `-2`, which is incorrect based on the mathematical operations performed by the `getDifference()` method. The assertion in the test case does not match the actual outcome of the method when the inputs are all negative numbers. This mismatch between the expected result specified in the test case (`-2`) and the actual result from the method (`2`) is what causes the test to fail.

/*
The failure of the test `testMixedSignValues` in the `ProductGetDifferenceTest` class is due to an incorrect expected value in the assertion. The test sets the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in the `Product` object as `-2`, `3`, `1`, and `-4` respectively, and then evaluates the `getDifference()` method which computes the expression `(a * b) - (c * d)`.

By substituting the values:
- `a * b` = `-2 * 3` = `-6`
- `c * d` = `1 * -4` = `-4`
- Therefore, `(a * b) - (c * d)` = `-6 - (-4)` = `-6 + 4` = `-2`

However, the test assertion expects the result to be `10`, which is incorrect based on the given method implementation and input values. The actual result computed by the method is `-2`, which leads to the assertion failure reported in the error logs:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Result should be 10 for mixed sign values expected:<10> but was:<-2>
```
This discrepancy between the expected result in the test assertion (`10`) and the actual result from the method execution (`-2`) is the reason for the test failure. To fix this issue, the expected value in the test should be corrected to match the actual outcome of the method based on the provided input values.

    int result = product.getDifference();
    assertEquals("Result should be 10 for mixed sign values", 10, result);

The test failure for `testLargeValues` in the `ProductGetDifferenceTest` class is due to an arithmetic overflow. The test sets the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to large integers and then calculates the product and difference using the formula `a * b - c * d`. 

Here's a breakdown of the computation:
- `a = 10000`, `b = 30000`, `c = 10000`, `d = 40000`
- The expected result of `a * b - c * d` is `-1000000000`.

However, the actual result returned from the `getDifference()` method was `-100000000`, which is off by a factor of 10. This discrepancy suggests that there was an overflow during the multiplication of the integers before the subtraction was performed. In Java, when the result of an integer operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `int` (i.e., `Integer.MAX_VALUE` which is `2^31 - 1` or `2147483647`), it wraps around to the minimum value (`Integer.MIN_VALUE` which is `-2^31` or `-2147483648`) and continues from there, which can lead to unexpected results.

Given the large values involved in the multiplication (`10000 * 30000 = 300000000` and `10000 * 40000 = 400000000`), the operations approach the limit of integer storage, thereby increasing the likelihood of an overflow and incorrect calculations. 

To resolve this issue, the calculation needs to handle larger values, possibly by using a larger data type such as `long` in Java, which can accommodate the results of these multiplications without overflow. Alternatively, the logic should implement checks and handling for potential overflows when dealing with large integer values to ensure the correctness of the arithmetic operations.

@Category(Categories.boundary.class)
public void testLargeValues() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setA(10000);
    product.setB(30000);
    product.setC(10000);
    product.setD(40000);
    int result = product.getDifference();
    assertEquals("Result should be -1000000000 for large values", -1000000000, result);
