Certainly! Here are multiple test scenarios for the `setC(int c)` method within the `Product` class:

``` 
Scenario 1: Set a positive value to 'c'
Details:
  TestName: setCWithPositiveValue
  Description: Validate whether the setC method can successfully assign a positive integer value to the field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product.
  Act: Call setC with a positive integer value, for example, setC(123).
  Assert: Since the setter does not return a value, check if 'c' has been updated using an indirect approach (assuming the presence of a getter or another method to validate would break scenario constraints).
Validation:
  Clarify that the method successfully assigns positive integers to 'c' and maintains correct state.
  The test is significant to ensure that positive settings required by business logic are handled correctly.

Scenario 2: Set a negative value to 'c'
Details:
  TestName: setCWithNegativeValue
  Description: Test whether the setC method can handle and correctly assign a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance.
  Act: Invoke setC with a negative integer value, example, setC(-321).
  Assert: Similar to the positive case, verify 'c' reflects this negative value, under the same constraints as above.
Validation:
  Confirm that the method correctly handles negative numbers, ensuring proper data handling and robustness.
  This test highlights the capacity of the system to maintain data integrity with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Set 'c' to zero
Details:
  TestName: setCWithZero
  Description: Check if zero value is correctly stored in the 'c' field when the setC method is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Product instance.
  Act: Execute setC(0).
  Assert: Check if 'c' is precisely zero, under the implied constraints.
Validation:
  Verify that the system correctly handles zero, which might represent a neutral or default state.
  This test is crucial for validating boundary values ensuring zero is a manageable case.

Scenario 4: Handling Integer MAX_VALUE
Details:
  TestName: setCWithMaxInt
  Description: Assure that the setC method can correctly assign the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product object.
  Act: Utilize setC with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Validate whether 'c' is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE, keeping in mind the existing constraints.
Validation:
  Confirm setC method's capability to handle and store the maximum integer boundary condition effectively.
  Essential from a boundary-testing perspective to ensure extreme values are supported.

Scenario 5: Handling Integer MIN_VALUE
Details:
  TestName: setCWithMinInt
  Description: Confirm that setC method can accurately save the minimum integer negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product object.
  Act: Use setC with Integer.MIN_VALUE.
  Assert: Check if 'c' holds Integer.MIN_VALUE, adhering to the constraints specified.
Validation:
  Ascertain if the method can robustly manage extreme negative cases.
  Crucial for complete boundary value testing and underlining the robustness of the method under extreme conditions.
``` 

Each scenario respects the constraints set out not to assume the presence of any additional methods (including getter methods for verification) in the `Product` class description you provided. These tests consider a broad spectrum of input possibilities to thoroughly validate `setC(int c)`.
